However, the big bad evil guy is an eldritch being from another plane of existence, and he infects minds by using sound and imagery that would be completely alien to this setting. Hence the tonal shift to electronic music.\n\nFor example: the first time they will properly meet an infected one would be in the form of a young girl and during the battle, this song mix will be playing:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DDFNgs7gp8M\n\nAs this being suits it's sounds to fit the people it's trying to drive mad, it would sound different depending on the person.

He also became buddies with Steve Reich when the latter saw him perform Electric Counterpoint and he recently released a collaboration album with Penderecki that included his 48 Responses to Polymorphia. His arrangements really bring Radiohead songs to life, like the eerie quarter-tone strings that pop up at the end of Climbing Up the Walls:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/qbtZyuOMdHI?t=3m50s\n\n-LCD Soundsystem: James Murphy, the man behind LCD Soundsystem, paid tribute to Steve Reich last year when he remixed a David Bowie song using samples reminiscent of Reich's classic Clapping piece. And tracks like All My Friends really do bare a lot of Reich's influence: they start out as simple, repetitive pulses that slowly add more and more layers until you find yourself unexpectedly getting your freak on the dance floor:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjT7a23A9CQ\n\nAnyway those are my three examples.

Sometimes people make comparisons of metal to classical music that are corny. I.e. \"Mozart would play metal today.\" \n\nLike, no, he'd probably like and write some form of classical music today. But, there are some cases of real overlap, such as Marche des Scythes, by Joseph-Nicolas-Pancrace Royer:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMbBYR_lplE\n\nSome stuff in there really isn't so different in feeling and tone than an [Eddie van Halen guitar solo](https://youtu.be/L9r-NxuYszg?t=165), especially [2:31 in the harpsichord video.](https://youtu.be/SMbBYR_lplE?t=152)\n\nIt's like the feeling communicated is *less* different in this case.\n\nA good harpsichord has a powerful, crunchy yet clean sound to it, not too far off of an electric guitar.\n\nAnother one:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DzxlMfUzqIM?t=74\n\nThat one *really* blurs the line, IMHO. It sounds angry like metal. I almost suspect that if Royer had been born today, he'd *actually* play in a metal band.

{"query": "Considering the specific emotional context of grappling with suicidal thoughts and feelings of predestined damnation, and the subsequent appreciation for bleak and beautiful black metal albums like Dissection's *Night's Blood* and Enslaved's *Lightning*, how do metalheads, particularly those drawn to extreme subgenres like black, death, doom, and grind metal, initially discover and connect with these genres, and is it possible to genuinely appreciate such abrasive music without experiencing significant negative emotions like anger, frustration, or nihilism", "combined_text": "What got you into extreme metal? **Just a heads up, those who do not listen to black/death/doom/grind or similar genres need not apply**\n\nAs someone who does not know a single person with a strong affinity for heavy music, I often evangelize extreme metal to my friends with the hopes of having someone to discuss with. So far, no attempts have been successful in the slightest, which leads me to wonder, how do most metalheads get into the genre? My first descent into the world of extreme metal was during grade 11 when I was contemplating suicide and believed I was predestined to go to Hell, which I coped with by listening to black metal. I loved how, even though the music was so bleak and painful, it was so dreadfully beautiful. When I listened to Night's Blood by Dissection or Lightening by Enslaved was really the only time life seemed to make any sense or hold any sort of value. Nowadays, as I'm operating more on anger, frustration, and nihilism, I can really only stomach really chaotic, noisy music, such as [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ0DZ8NZxnI) or [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIB9Cai5kZ4). Pretty much everything else, even death metal, seems too melodic and cheerful to listen to.\n\nSo I'm just wondering, can anyone get into these genres without the influence of negative emotions? I can still enjoy this music when I'm happy, but did I need those negative feelings in the first place to see the merit in the music? Thank you very much for your responses. (Which I do not expect, my last self-post here got absolutely no attention)\n\ntl;dr: Why listen to abrasive music?\n\n", "score": 38.0, "url":

This is no doubt my favorite style!\n\n**Second example (at around 2:35)** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDyYK0rtD2Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDyYK0rtD2Y)  \nNow this might sound more like general jazz, but I really enjoy the notes he plays at exactly 2:53. Now notes played like that just has to have a certain name to it! I know I've heard them in many jazz songs before, but this is the only example I have ready to listen to! Gaah!! \n\nWould really appreciate any recommendations on similar songs as these! Would really enjoy having some relaxing songs to listen to this upcoming weekend!

{"query": "Considering the surprising shifts in rapping style observed from artists known primarily for non-technical or lyrical approaches, what are some notable examples of rappers like Trippie Redd (\"Can You Rap Like Me\" from the 2017 SoundCloud wave), Lil Yachty (\"Ma$e in 97\" from the 2017 SoundCloud wave), Lil Pump (particularly his verse on \"Welcome To The Party\"), Fivio Foreign (on Kanye West's \"Off The Grid\"), and Ski Mask The Slump God (on Members Only's \"Empty,\" a serious reflection on XXXTENTACION's death and their past relationship), where they delivered unexpectedly technically proficient or emotionally resonant rap verses that deviated significantly from their established styles", "combined_text": "What are the best examples of usually non-technical/lyrical rappers going try-hard for a song? [Trippie Redd - Can You Rap Like Me?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOhVai2vXo)\n\nOne of the most surprising songs to come out of the 2017 soundcloud wave. After he blew up doing the shouty singing I never would've expected to rap so cleanly over a beat like this. He makes it sound like this is his normal style.\n\n[Lil Yachty - Ma$e in 97](https://www.google.com/search?q=lil+yachty+mase+in+97&amp;oq=lil+yachty+mase+in+&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0i355i512j46i512j69i57j0i22i30l5j0i390.3881j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#:~:text=Carnage%20%2D%20Mase%20In%20%2797%20Ft.%20Lil%20Yachty%20(Official%20Music%20Video))\n\nAlso one of the most surprising songs to come out of the 2017 soundcloud wave. It was unbelievable that this was the same dude who made minnesota and one night\n\n[Lil Pump's verse on Welcome To The Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgOXIEhHU1Y)\n\nLil Pumps greatest verse ever which is not saying much AT ALL. But he's the reason I had this otherwise garbage song in my playlist. The comments on the video agree that this was a surprisingly great verse from Pump, flow and rhythm wise. I have no clue how Pump managed to sound more coherent rapping fast than in his normal tempo.\n\n[Fivio Foreign's verse on Off The Grid by Kanye West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbDMNjT-QpI)\n\nAfter hearing Fivio rap in bulletpoints during his XXL cypher and freestyle the complete 180 he did on this verse was INSANE. The shock i had during the listening party was unmatched. Kanye can lowkey qualify for this too because you never hear a flow like that out of him, even with the punch-ins it's crazy.\n\n[Ski Mask The Slump God's verse on Empty by Members Only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR68rqH369g)\n\nThis is the ONLY deathly serious Ski Mask The Slump God rap verse you'll ever hear. It was written about XXXTENTACION's death and the guilt he felt about their falling out before he passed. It's really mellow and slow compared to the rest, but it showed that Ski can still be a compelling rapper and doesn't only do pop culture references over zany production.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do y'all got ?", "score": 728.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/v4ghc0/what_are_the_best_examples_of_usually/", "name": "t3_v4ghc0", "source_subreddit": "hiphopheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Trippie Redd", "Lil Yachty", "Lil Pump", "Fivio Foreign", "Kanye West", "Ski Mask The Slump God"], "songs": ["Can You Rap Like Me?", "Ma$e in 97", "Welcome To The Party", "Off The Grid", "Empty"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["missing my idols", "Thouxanbanfauni wounds", "\"Letter to My Momma\"", "Off the Grid", "\"you gotta move different when you in the industry\"", "nun of dat", "Kodak on vibin", "no more parties in la", "BABY DADDY", "D.O.R.

WILLOW)\" (5.95), Mars Argo's \"Angry\" (5.60), Megan Thee Stallion & Beyonce's \"Savage Remix\" (9.32), and Soulja Boy's \"Crank That (Soulja Boy),\" and subsequently, what", "combined_text": "The Popheads Jukebox Revival, Week 169: I Don't Care, It's Your Problem Welcome to a new week of the Jukebox! Here are last week’s results:\n\n* Hatchie - Quicksand: 8.33\n* IVE - LOVE DIVE: 7.45\n* Shakira &amp; Rauw Alejandro - Te Felicito: 7.43\n* PinkPantheress - Where you are (feat. WILLOW): 5.95\n* Mars Argo - Angry: 5.60\n\n-\n\n* Megan Thee Stallion - Savage Remix (feat. Beyonce): 9.32\n* Soulja Boy - Crank That (Soulja Boy): 6.77\n\nHatchie snags one of the higher rated tracks of the year while IVE, Shakira &amp; Rauw Alejandro all still score a respectable 7+. PinkPantheress and Mars Ago flounder a little and fall below the 6 range. For our throwbacks Megan and Beyonce score yet another 9+ week for the catch-up tracks. In the general throwbacks, Soulja Boy ends up with quite the divisive scores and evens out into the high 6 range.\n\n---\n\n###Rules Refresher\n\n1. Rate the songs a score from 1 to 10. Please keep it to one decimal place at the most (so 7.5 is fine but 7.58 is not). Also don’t get too hung up on the final scores. This is a fun exercise and not a competition so don’t worry about over/under rating things. Just give what you think the song is to you.\n\n2. For your review, reply to the comment that will be posted by one of us for each song. Avoid posting your reviews as a top level comment cause we probably won’t notice them if you do. Non-reviews such as questions or general commentary as upper level comments are fine.\n\n3. Must have some sort of justification. Try to be a bit more concise than “It’s a bop!” or “I don’t like it”. Explain why! It doesn’t have to be long, two or three sentences can be plenty (though more is definitely allowed). We reserve the right not to include a review in the final total if proper justification is not given.\n\n4. You don’t have to review each song to participate! You can do all of them or only the ones you’re familiar with.\n\n5. The thread will be open for 6 days and close the following Wednesday at 6PM EST. The scores will be calculated and a new post will come up the next day (Thursday) at 3PM EST  with the next week’s tracks.\n\n---\n\n###This Week’s Tracks\n\n\n* [Ava Max - Maybe You’re the Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijS_orLb6VU)\n* [Khalid - Skyline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-0tTi7GaPg)\n* [Lady Gaga - Hold My Hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2CIAKVTOrc)\n* [PSY - that that (feat.

Wiz Khalifa and Smoke DZA - Only One**] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHkEogljLuU)\nThis song is off of the last Big KRIT tape and I fucking love it. The beat is silky smooth and has an awesome bassline. KRIT drops a solid verse and Wiz spits some of his best shit in a while. I also like Smoke DZA's voice on this song. 4/5 stars.\n\n[**Ab-Soul - Lyrically Speaking**] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtawEOuzD_U) This is a joint of off Ab's first tape, Longterm: The Mixtape. Nothing special about the beat and the mixing is pretty shitty, but Ab is spitting some serious heat. 3/5\n\n[**Homecoming - Kanye West**]  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ488QrqGE4) An amazing allegory of a track.

It also cemented them as one of the top foreign girl groups in Japan alongside KARA as this song was their first single to sell 100,000 units within its first week. This single was a smash hit not only in Japan but also Taiwan and South Korea; the single was certified double platinum by RIAJ, peaked at #3 in Taiwan's charts, and also moved around 1.5m downloaded units in South Korea. \n\nThe song is a Girls Generation staple with the girls in synchronous yellow uniforms and black biker suits singing about having fun and riding a taxi (surprise surprise).

Edit: With the help of some insightful comments, I've pinpointed what I think is my favourite aspect of the music I enjoy. I like some virtuosity, like the Chopin Ballades, but nothing Liszt-level. I still like having those melodious, intimate moments, but also some virtuosic sections with chords, runs, etc. Mendelssohn's Trios and Chopin's Ballades fit this description perfectly, which is why they are my favourites.\n\nI've been enjoying Chopin, Mendelssohn, Liszt, Rach and other composers in the Romantic style, specifically piano solos and occasionally trios. I particularly like Chopin's Ballades, Nocturnes and Barcarolle, as well as Mendelssohn's piano trios.\n\nI've also found some modern composers who compose in that style, but always buried deep in the back alley of the Internet. I found [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI_okr26VPUlPe3NcvWYcnA) 2 years ago.

{"query": "viable as remixes, or is there another reason?\" ``` Why, despite the historical popularity of mashups alongside dance music in the 1980s and hip-hop/R&B in the 1990s, and their continued presence on platforms like YouTube and TikTok (including recent viral mashups like 'As It Was', 'Cruel Summer', and 'Deja Vu'), as well as early examples like a mashup of Ariana Grande's 'Step On Up' and Britney Spears' 'Gimme More' and Mariah Carey's mashup of 'Heartbreaker' and 'If You Should Ever Be Lonely', aren't mashups or mashup albums as commonly produced and capitalized on by artists and record labels as remixes, which have become a mainstream staple with artists like Michael Jackson, Madonna, The Beatles, J.Lo, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Shakira, and Aerosmith & Run-D.M.C. (with \"Walk This Way\") achieving significant commercial success and influence? ```", "combined_text": "Why Aren’t Mashups as Popular as Remixes Ever since the rise in their popularity alongside dance music in the ‘80s and hip-hop/R&amp;B in the ‘90s, remixes have become a mainstay in pop music, with Michael Jackson, Madonna, The Beatles, J.Lo, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, and Shakira all having each of their remix albums become a part of the top 20 best selling remix albums of all time. In fact, the remix as an art form has also been quite influential and innovative in pop music as well, with [Aerosmith and Run-D.M.C.‘s ‘Walk This Way’](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4B_UYYPb-Gk) being one of the earliest and most influential examples of the fusion between rap and rock.\n\nWith the rise of TikTok’s popularity towards the end of the 2010s, remixes continued to remain popular as many viral TikTok sounds were actually remixes of songs. However, I’ve also noticed a large portion of TikTok sounds being mashups between multiple songs, such as a recent [mashup between ‘As It Was’, ‘Cruel Summer’, and ‘Deja Vu’](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mGLRnrsrfmI) getting significantly popular on the app. Additionally, mashups have always been pretty popular on YouTube since its inception, with [this mashup of Ariana Grande’s ‘Step On Up’ and Britney Spears’ ‘Gimme More’](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7Y5dS7cSiI) being the first example I can think of. Even back in ‘90s, some remixes were actually mashups, such as [this mashup by Mariah Carey between ‘Heartbreaker’ and ‘If You Should Ever Be Lonely’](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4WpOAM2HoMA).\n\nYet, mashups or mashup albums don’t seem to be as common of a practice by artists or record labels. I’ve tried thinking about some of the reasons why that may be, such as copyright infringement laws, but with the continued popularity of sampling in today’s music industry I just don’t see that being an issue for record labels. \n\nSo how come mashups aren’t something artists and record labels capitalize on?

{"query": "initiated.\" Rewritten Question: Considering The Kid Laroi brought Australian drill group ONEFOUR, often described as the \"NWA of Australia,\" onto the stage at his Sydney show as a surprise, and given that ONEFOUR has faced a performance ban and manager communication restrictions from NSW police since 2019, including their previous tour cancellation and a complete ban on performing, what are the potential repercussions or fallout from Laroi's decision to provide ONEFOUR with their first major live performance since 2019 (beginning with their 2020 collaboration 'My City' and followed by their 2019 track 'Shanks And Shivs' and 2020 track 'Spot The Difference'), especially considering ONEFOUR's history of members being incarcerated and their pioneering role in Australian drill music alongside collaborations with artists like A$AP Ferg and UK drill artists", "combined_text": "Last night, The Kid Laroi brought Australian drill group ‘ONEFOUR’ out at his Sydney show as a surprise. Known by some as the ‘NWA of Australia,’ this was their first major live performance since the NSW police banned them from performing and prohibited their manager from contacting them in 2019. [Link to main article.](https://amp.abc.net.au/article/11779746)\n\nQuotes from Laroi from last night:\n\n“These guys have been banned from performing in Australia, and guess what? I don’t fuck with that.”\n\n“So tonight, I’m gonna fucking give them what they deserve, and they’re gonna come out here and do a few songs for us tonight. Let’s fucking go Sydney.”\n\n\n*The impromptu mini-set began with ONEFOUR and LAROI performing their joint 2020 single ‘My City’ (the closing track from ONEFOUR’s ‘Against All Odds’ EP). LAROI then dipped away from the mic, watching on while ONEFOUR played two of their own cuts: 2019’s ‘Shanks And Shivs’ and 2020’s ‘Spot The Difference’*\n\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with ONEFOUR, they’ve exploded onto the Australian rap scene over the past five years pioneering aussie drill music, and have collaborated with Laroi as well as A$AP Ferg and various UK drill artists. This is despite many of their members being in and out of prison, and even being [completely banned from their scheduled tour and banned from performing at all by NSW police since 2019.](https://amp.abc.net.au/article/11779746) Their manager was also barred from communicating with the group in any form at all.\n\n\nThis was their first major live performance since the ban, and second performance at all after a private gig was played a couple of days ago. Given Laroi’s international success, I think It’ll be interesting to see if there is any fallout/repercussions from this decision. Hopefully though it may lead to ONEFOUR having their ban lifted.

Here are the lyrics of the second chorus, which is my favorite part of the song:\n\n\"One track mind, one track heart\n\nIf I fail, I'll fall apart\n\nMaybe it is all a test\n\n'Cause I feel like I'm the worst\n\nSo I always act like I'm the best\n\n\nIf you are not very careful\n\nYour possessions will possess you\n\nTV taught me how to feel\n\nNow real life has no appeal\"\n\nThe video itself is also pretty great. It's a self-aware video about fame, pop-music, and money. The color scheme and visuals are wonderfully graphic. Reminds me a lot of Roy Lichtenstein.\n\nSome more samples of Marina:\n\n[Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDr7aTfBffU) Off her newest album: Froot.\n\n[Power and Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3Rp_0hoNTY) \"Give a little, get a lot.

Depending on what you liked about \"Fear Fun\" - its boozy, bar-folk sound or Tillman's confessional, shameless lyrical playfulness - this could be seen as a leap forward, sideways or off of the ledge of sanity. In many ways it's all of those things...but it's also INCREDIBLE. \n\n\nThose looking for more of the folk sound found on \"Fear Fun\" might initially be disappointed. I was. The arrangements on \"Honeybear\" are crammed with instruments - from swelling violins to electric guitar solos to wind flutes, often in the same song - to the point of near-parody. He's going for drunken, lovelorn lounge-singer and nails it almost too well.  What keeps the thing from drowning in a pool of its own cheese are the beautiful melodies and, even more so, Tillman's phenomenal (and phenomenally excessive) lyrics. He teeters back-and-forth so completely between heartfelt lover and loutish drunkard that the two eventually blend into a crazy, compelling mess of a man. He's madly in love with a woman, and then angry and dismissive of her (one song is a declaration of never wanting to leave her side and a few songs later he's being asked to choke her during sex - and reveling in it because of how resentful he is). He celebrates his life of excess and then hates himself for the way he acts. He wants to be loved and left alone. It's an amazing balancing act that could've come off as overblown if it wasn't so damn sincere and believable. My initial disappointment in the extreme shift in style eventually gave way to awe. Like Tillman himself, \"I Love You, Honeybear\" is hilarious, heartfelt, totally outrageous and ultimately spectacular.\n\nListen - First single, [Bored in the U.S.A.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JODshFyKHuA)", "score": 22.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/2s2rwk/first_listen_review_father_john_misty_i_love_you/", "name": "t3_2s2rwk", "source_subreddit": "indieheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Father John Misty", "Josh Tillman"], "albums": ["I Love You", "Honeybear"], "songs": ["I Love You", "Honeybear", "Bored in the U.S.A."]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Bored in the USA", "Stairway to Heaven", "Bored in the USA", "Chateau Lobby", "Bored in the USA", "A lady never tells", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Bored", "Stairway to Heaven", "Chateau Lobby", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "True Affection", "An Ideal Husband"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_cno22ef", "score": 6.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Bored in the USA"]}}, {"name": "t1_cnlr2ix", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cnmv3mc", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Bob Dylan"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Bored in the USA", "Chateau Lobby"]}}, {"name": "t1_cnpywjb", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Fun", "Irony of Faith"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Bored in the USA"]}}, {"name": "t1_cnmv4uf", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["A lady never tells"]}}, {"name": "t1_cnlnk6g", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_cnlodk3", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_cnnmc8g", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Bored"]}}, {"name": "t1_cnpz6vx", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cnv3j8a", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Chateau Lobby"]}}, {"name": "t1_cnw3qgj", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_cntuq5m", "score": 0.0, "entities": {"artists": ["FJM", "Sufjan Stevens", "Arcade Fire"], "albums": ["OK Computer"], "songs": ["True Affection", "An Ideal Husband"]}}], "bucket": "other"}

{"query": "Considering someone attended a Young Thug concert at The Observatory in Santa Ana, and while they weren't a huge fan beforehand, how did the surprise appearance of Travis Scott, who performed \"Mamacita\" and \"Skyfall\" while repeatedly throwing water bottles into the crowd, significantly impact Young Thug's stage presence and the overall energy of the show, especially given Travis Scott's announced upcoming tour with Young Thug and Metro Boomin also at The Observatory, and as evidenced by the poster's videos and photo", "combined_text": "Went to a Young Thug show last night So last night I got free tickets to see Young Thug at The Observatory in Santa Ana. I wouldn't say I'm a fan of his but I like his music and think it's fun. After sitting through a slew of mediocre openers, Young Thug finally comes on. His first few songs were good and everyone was having a good time but all he was doing was kinda walking back and forth on stage, not giving his songs the live presentation they deserve. Suddenly, he brings out MOTHER FUCKIN TRAVIS $COTT!!!! The whole room goes nuts and the hype in the room went up x10. They did Mamacita and Skyfall. Travis kept slamming water bottles into the front of the stage, causing water to splash everywhere and the bottles bounced to the ceiling. Travis stayed for a couple more songs, acting as Young Thug's hype man and the crowd was still going nuts. Even after Travis left, for the last two songs you could easily see a change in Young Thug's live mannerisms. He was so much more hype now. I've seen Travis live 3 times now and this just goes to show how contagious Travis' energy is. Anyone that has a chance to see him live ABSOLUTELY needs to do it, no matter how much of his music you know. \nHere's a pic:\n\nhttp://m.imgur.com/p4LNj1p\n\nTL;DR: Went to a Young Thug show and it turned into a Travis $cott show.\n\nEDIT: Travis did mention that he's going on tour soon with Young Thug and Metro Boomin and will be doing a show at the Observatory.\n\nEDIT 2: uploaded a couple videos from last night. Please excuse my vertical video.

This is going to be a tribute to the nostalgic era of the late 2000s and early 2010s, when pop radio was flooded with rap crossovers built around big pop choruses and heavy dance beats that made for floor-filling club bangers or featured vocalists who lent these raps a pop song's sweetness and bombast. Given that we're now about a decade removed from the height of this era, it feels like a perfect time to look back on it all, and att the center of this rate are three of the most prolific artists of this trend, as well as a selection of the most fun and indelible hits from other artists who used this sound, so without further ado let's allow my cohost u/izeasklapaucius introduce you to....\n\n# Flo Rida:\n\nTramar Lacel Dillard (born September 16, 1979), better known as Flo Rida, is an American rapper, singer and songwriter from Carol City, Florida, and I did NOT just steal the first sentence of his Wikipedia page to opens this blurb because further introduction would just be too long-winded (or maybe I’m just lazy). At this point, HOW could you not know about Flo Rida? Everyone with age ranging from 6-60 with access to Internet and radio in 2009 have got to know about him. His debut single, \"Low (feat. T-Pain)\", went to #1 in Hot 100, which is difficult to get, not everyone has that. You need a filler pop track to add in the post for your wacky, quirky scene in [TV shows](https://youtu.be/_fyEarGbpXM?t=62) and [movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr9_GfeoCjk)? The Only One Flo got you covered. He even still finds success as a Eurovision contestant representing [San Marino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkhiH-JXFPs). That’s how relevant he is to this day.\n\nSpeaking of Flo Rida’s music, much like all of the other pop-rap boys here, he mainly sings about partying and having a good time. Maybe he’ll rap about girls too. Some dick-sucking bops here and there. But one of his hits stood out for me. On surface level, you might think \"I Cry\" is just another one of his poppier tracks, but dig into the lyrics and you’ll find that he raps about Japan earthquake and Norway mass shooting, two things that you’ll rarely find on a dance-pop track. Not only that, but few lines on the verses talks about how Flo is still trying to cope on his sister that died because of Bronchitis.\n\n&gt;Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish/Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanish\n\nThis is, I think, what sets Flo Rida apart from other artists in this rate. Even though this is the only occurrence of him rapping about personal stuff, he’s not afraid to bares it all and show the audience his personal side. You’ll never hear a pop-rap artist gets this vulnerable anymore.\n\nWe will be rating selected hits from the debut *Mail on Sunday* to 2015 EP titled *My House*.\n\n[Low (feat.

Mr. 305 a.k.a. *Gotti* soundtrack composer. Unlike the other main acts in this rate, the breakthrough moment of one Mr. Armando Christian Perez had been a slow burn. Before the world knows it, he had already released three studio albums under independent label and scored top 40 hit back in 2004 with \"Culo\", which features fellow icon Lil’ Jon (they would later become lifelong musical besties, with Jon producing many of his material). Pitbull’s true rise to stardom came in 2009 with \"I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)\", a combination of hip-hop groove and thumping Eurodance beat that peaked at #2(!) in BB100 (*Boom Boom Pow* blocked it). Since then, he essentially rebranded himself as a pop star and had released many dance-floor bops which ranging from about partying, partying with girls, and, get this, to partying like it’s your last!\n\nPitbull’s music resonate with a lot of people, including young me who had never been to a party nor club, and I reckon it’s because the themes that are present on every single om ne of his hits. From the samples of popular songs that get smartly (or cheaply on some songs) reworked, varying cities and/or places he shouts out on the verses, and last but certainly not the least, his trademark[(ed, literally)](https://www.nme.com/news/music/eeeeyo-pitbull-has-trademarked-his-signature-yell-2651507) yell and ad-libs that just gets you and your ass going. Whenever you need some kind of escapism in your life, Pitbull is ready to give you some.\n\nHis popularity dwindled in the mid-2010s onward ([as did the quality of our lives, which is no coincidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8v689j/you_can_predict_whether_a_year_was_good_based_on/)) since I guess people doesn’t want to go down and yell timber anymore, but that doesn’t and won’t stop us from rating his work. We will be doing that with selected hits from 2009 to 2014.\n\n[Hotel Room Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2up_Eq6r6Ko)\n\n[I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2tMV96xULk)\n\n[Hey Baby (Drop It to the Floor) \\[feat.

After releasing some mixtapes on late 2000s and appearing on 2009 XXL Freshman Class, B.o.B’s name quickly soared to night sky like shooting star with the release of his debut single, \"Nothin’ on You\". Although short-lived, B.o.B’s commercial peak produced slew of the most iconic singles of the decade. Those come mostly in the form of collaboration with other pop or pop-adjacent acts, including the aforementioned Bruno Mars one, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, and many others.\n\nWhat makes B.o.B stands out from other pop-rap acts in this rate? I’d say his choruses and the artists he’s collabed with has always been the key to his success. Now, I’m not saying he’s a bad rapper. His verses are fun and at worst, passable on some of the singles. But real talk here, you could probably find more people that could recite Hayley William’s part on \"Airplanes\" more than the ones with its verses. I think it’s one of those things where the popularity of an artist’s work eclipsed that of artist themselves. Good or bad, take that however you will. But at the end of the day, his songs still bop and we’re happy. And we’re ALSO happy because B.o.B didn’t go out his way to destroy his legacy as the \"Airplane\" guy or the \"Just The Way You Are\" guy by releasing a [Neil deGrasse Tyson diss track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMMJ2Dgkrm0) in which he, among other conspiracy theories he believed in, raps about how the world is a “flatline”, right? Right, guys?\n\nBad cosmography takes aside, in this rate we will be rating B.o.B’s selected singles from his first two studio albums, 2010 *B.o.B Presents: The Adventure of Bobby Ray* and 2012 *Strange Clouds*.\n\n[Nothin On You (feat.

Among the artists spotlighted here we have uncle/nephew duo **LMFAO**, first Asian-American act to hit #1 on Billboard **Far East Movement**, Katy's ex **Travie McCoy** and his group **Gym Class Heroes**, and many more!

The deadline for ballots is not until mid-July, so feel free to take your time and listen to the songs and albums as many times as you like!\n* Be sure to use [the prepared link](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=jackisboredtoday&amp;subject=Early%2010s%20Pop%20Rap%20Ballot&amp;message=Username%3A%20%0A%0AArtist%3A%20Flo%20Rida%0A%0ALow%20%28feat.%20T-Pain%29%3A%0A%0ARight%20Round%3A%E2%80%A8%0A%0ASugar%20%28feat.%20Wynter%29%3A%0A%0AJump%20%28feat.%20Nelly%20Furtado%29%3A%0A%0AClub%20Can’t%20Handle%20Me%20%28feat.%20David%20Guetta%29%3A%0A%0AWho%20Dat%20Girl%20%28feat.%20Akon%29%3A%E2%80%A8%0A%0AGood%20Feeling%3A%0A%0AWild%20Ones%20%28feat.%20Sia%29%3A%E2%80%A8%0A%0AWhistle%3A%20%E2%80%A8%0A%0AI%20Cry%3A%20%0A%0AMy%20House%3A%0A%0AGDFR%3A%0A%0AArtist%3A%20Pitbull%0A%0AHotel%20Room%20Service%3A%E2%80%A8%0A%0AI%20Know%20You%20Want%20Me%20%28Calle%20Ocho%29%3A%0A%0AHey%20Baby%20%28Drop%20It%20To%20the%20Floor%29%20%5Bfeat.%20T-Pain%5D%3A%0A%0AGive%20Me%20Everything%20%28feat.%20Ne-Yo%2C%20Afrojack%20and%20Nayer%29%3A%0A%0AInternational%20Love%20%28feat.%20Chris%20Brown%29%3A%0A%0ABack%20In%20Time%3A%0A%0AFeel%20This%20Moment%20%28feat.%20Christina%20Aguilera%29%3A%E2%80%A8%0A%0ADon’t%20Stop%20the%20Party%20%28feat.%20TJR%29%3A%E2%80%A8%0A%0AFireball%20%28feat.%20John%20Ryan%29%3A%0A%0ATimber%20%28feat.%20Kesha%29%3A%20%0A%0ATime%20of%20Our%20Lives%20%28feat.%20Ne-Yo%29%3A%0A%0AArtist%3A%20B.o.B%0A%0ANothin%20On%20You%20%28feat.%20Bruno%20Mars%29%3A%E2%80%A8%0A%0AAirplanes%20%28feat.%20Hayley%20Williams%29%3A%0A%0AMagic%20%28feat.%20Rivers%20Cuomo%29%3A%0A%0ADon’t%20Let%20Me%20Fall%3A%0A%0AStrange%20Clouds%20%28feat.%20Lil%20Wayne%29%3A%0A%0A%E2%80%A8%E2%80%A8So%20Good%3A%0A%0ABoth%20of%20Us%20%28feat.%20Taylor%20Swift%29%3A%0A%0AOut%20of%20My%20Mind%20%28feat.%20Nicki%20Minaj%29%3A%0A%0AArtist%3A%20Far%20East%20Movement%0A%0ALike%20a%20G6%20%28feat.%20The%20Cataracs%20%26%20Dev%29%3A%E2%80%A8%0A%0ARocketeer%20%28feat.%20Ryan%20Tedder%29%3A%0A%0ALive%20My%20Life%20%28feat.%20Justin%20Bieber%29%3A%20%0A%0AArtist%3A%20LMFAO%0A%0AParty%20Rock%20Anthem%20%28feat.%20Lauren%20Bennett%20%26%20Goonrock%29%3A%0A%0ASexy%20and%20I%20Know%20It%3A%20%0A%0ASorry%20for%20Party%20Rocking%3A%20%0A%0AShots%20%28feat.%20Lil%20Jon%29%3A%0A%0AArtist%3A%20Gym%20Class%20Heroes%2FTravie%20McCoy%0A%0ABillionaire%20%28feat.%20Bruno%20Mars%29%3A%20%0A%0AStereo%20Hearts%20%28feat.%20Adam%20Levine%29%3A%20%0A%0AAss%20Back%20Home%20%28feat.%20Neon%20Hitch%29%3A%20%0A%0A%E2%80%A8Artist%3A%20Wiz%20Khalifa%0A%0ARoll%20Up%3A%0A%0ANo%20Sleep%3A%0A%0AYoung%2C%20Wild%20%26%20Free%20%28feat.%20Bruno%20Mars%29%3A%0A%0AArtist%3A%20Jay-Z%0A%0AEmpire%20State%20of%20Mind%20%28feat.%20Alicia%20Keys%29%3A%0A%0ARun%20This%20Town%20%28feat.%20Rihanna%20%26%20Kanye%20West%29%3A%0A%0AYoung%20Forever%20%28feat.%20Mr.%20Hudson%29%3A%0A%0AArtist%3A%20Other%0A%0AComing%20Home%20%28feat.%20Skylar%20Grey%29%3A%0A%0ADangerous%20%28feat.%20Akon%29%3A%20%0A%0ARest%20of%20My%20Life%20%28feat.%20Usher%20%26%20David%20Guetta%29%3A%0A%0AWritten%20in%20the%20Stars%20%28feat.%20Eric%20Turner%29%3A%20%0A%0AWhere%20them%20Girls%20At%20%28feat.%20Flo%20Rida%20%26%20Nicki%20Minaj%29%3A%20%0A%0AMirror%20%28feat.%20Bruno%20Mars%29%3A%0A%0AThe%20Show%20Goes%20On%3A%E2%80%A8%E2%80%A8%0A%0AOut%20of%20My%20Head%20%28feat.%20Trey%20Songz%29%3A%20%0A%0AJust%20a%20Dream%3A%0A%0AHey%20Porsche%3A%0A%0ATie%20Me%20Down%20%28feat.%20Ray%20J%29%3A%20%0A%0ABackseat%20%28feat.%20The%20Caratacs%20%26%20Dev%29%3A%0A%0ALighters%20%28feat.%20Bruno%20Mars%29%3A%20%0A%0AWork%20Out%3A%0A%0A%E2%80%A8Chillin%20%28feat.%20Lady%20Gaga%29%3A%0A%0AScream%20%26%20Shout%20%28feat.%20Britney%20Spears%29%3A%20%0A%0A%23thatPOWER%20%28feat.%20Justin%20Bieber%29%3A%0A%0AEND) to send in your scores.

Shit, even Sideline Story was only expected to sell like 70k first week (but it went 200k because FNL grew his fanbase quickly).\n\nCole's single was going to be [Higher](www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjLwiNf7AVE), and I think it would've gotten several spins in NY, because it has that east coast feeling, and In the Morning could've done well too, because it came out around the time that Drake began his takeover and was on damn near every artist's single. \n\nDo you think that FNL would've been a classic as Cole always suggests, an east coast classic because the album feels very east coast (sorry NC, Cole barely claims himself as a southern artist), or just been a great album that didn't sell as much as it could have with an artist who had a lot of potential and underground hype?\n", "score": 44.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/2aykq4/if_friday_night_lights_released_as_an_album_how/", "name": "t3_2aykq4", "source_subreddit": "hiphopheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Cole", "Jay", "Drake"], "albums": ["Friday Night Lights"], "songs": ["Higher", "In the Morning"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Stairway to Heaven", "Stairway to Heaven", "Stairway to Heaven", "Stairway to Heaven", "Friday Night Lights", "Stairway to Heaven", "The Devil Went Down to Georgia", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_cj0bvda", "score": 9.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cj07pr1", "score": 7.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cj0fw0i", "score": 4.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cj08mf5", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cj083i9", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Friday Night Lights"]}}, {"name": "t1_cj0mnae", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cj0objf", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["The Devil Went Down to Georgia"]}}, {"name": "t1_cj0cpic", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_cj0i64k", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}], "bucket": "pop_culture"}

We're pre-selling copies of the album alongside the new [Queen of Hell](http://youtu.be/hN4-2jDuF5o) EP along with a bunch of other cool stuff.  We're selling spots to do background vocals on the album, some of the original sheet music from the Out of the Darkness sessions, and our drummer's bass drum heads.\n\nFrom our press release:\n&gt;The centerpiece of the album is the 9-minute sci-fi themed title track.  Guitarist and composer Josh Schwartz describes the track as \"a high octane headbanger with an unforgettable riff and an engaging story.  Stylistically it's Iron Maiden meets Rush with a bit of Meatloaf thrown in for bombast.\"  The tale begun in the lyrics is expanded in a short story by drummer Chris Haren, available in the limited box set edition of Time's Arrow. \n\nFor your consideration, then, I humbly ask you to listen to our music and, if you like what you hear, consider helping us further this album.\n\nThanks Shreddit!\n\n-Jesse K.\nASoT\n\nEDIT:  [Also, the Kill That Bitch Video](http://youtu.be/6ddI2eof3hc)", "score": 42.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/z3kdx/good_evening_shreddit_i_have_a_humble_request_of/", "name": "t3_z3kdx", "source_subreddit": "metal", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["A Sound of Thunder", "Queen"], "albums": ["Time's Arrow", "Out of the Darkness", "Queen of Hell EP"], "songs": ["Murderous Horde", "\"The centerpiece of the album is the 9-minute sci-fi themed title track\""]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Kill That Bitch", "Cool", "First I've heard of you"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_c614ueb", "score": 5.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Kill That Bitch"]}}, {"name": "t1_c6165ev", "score": 5.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Cool"]}}, {"name": "t1_c61gjap", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["First I've heard of you"]}}], "bucket": "other"}

{"query": "Considering songs like \"Season\" by City Girls featuring Lil Baby, \"Baby, I'm Jealous\" by Bebe Rexha featuring Doja Cat, and \"The Boy Is Mine\" by Brandy and Monica, what are some other compelling examples of songs where guest verses intentionally or unintentionally contradict the song's premise, create a confusing dialogue, or introduce seemingly unrelated topics, and do these instances enhance or detract from the overall listening experience", "combined_text": "Songs where the guest verse contradicts the point of the song [Season by City Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HomOmb2aG54) is a song about dating men who will spend a lot of money on gifts for you. The idea of this kind of relationship is presented pretty positively until Lil Baby's guest verse, where his first line is \"first of all bitch, you got me fucked up\". He then goes on to refute the premise of the song and basically says he isn't interested in dating women like them. \n\n[Baby, I'm Jealous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PznMpRASjAg) by Bebe Rexha is about a overly paranoid girlfriend who suspects her boyfriend is cheating on her. Doja Cat's guest verse is really interesting because she contradicts the premise of the song in three different ways. First, she says it's stupid to be paranoid about cheating. Second, she confesses she is the other woman who \"stole your man\" (which means the paranoia was kind of right?). Third, she says he's \"trash\" and not worth stressing over (which like...why did you bother having an affair with him if you have such a low opinion of him?). Regardless, Doja doesn't just contradict Bebe's verses, she kind of contradicts her own verse. \n\nI find these songs really interesting because sometimes I think there's a dialogue being created intentionally, and that can be really cool. [The Boy is Mine by Brandy and Monica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSIOp_K5GMw) is an iconic example. Capitalising on all the rumours about being real life rivals, they spun that tabloid gossip into gold by releasing a song where they play romantic rivals fighting over an unfaithful man. However, sometimes I listen to songs where collaborators contradict each other which feel a lot less deliberate, and a lot more confusing. Sometimes, collaborators won't even contradict the premise of the song, but will just talk about something completely off topic that feels really out of nowhere. \n\nWhat are some of the most interesting examples of this trope?

{"query": "What songs, beyond \"You Got It All\" by The Jets (and later covered by Britney Spears) written by Rupert Holmes (who also wrote \"The Pina Colada Song\" and intended it as a song for his daughter who tragically died of a brain tumor) and the songs from the musical *Rent* composed by Jonathan Larson (who passed away before its widespread success), evoke a deeper emotional response when you're aware of the background circumstances surrounding their creation", "combined_text": "Songs where knowing a bit of background (about the song, songwriter, etc). brings another layer of emotion to the song. What inspired this discussion was the 80s hit song [\"You Got it All\" by The Jets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOWtNx16yYY) (later recorded by [Britney Spears in 1997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9jTzZAFc8A), though not officially released until 3 years later). It's a catchy, sweet tune in itself. However, learning that the songwriter Rupert Holmes (Yes, \"The Pina Colada Song\" guy) wrote the song to appeal to his 10 year old daughter, whom sadly died of a brain tumor before the song ever became a hit adds an extra depth to the tune.\n\nAnd not really pop, but I recently saw a community theater production of *Rent* (and cried like a baby). Now many of the songs in Rent are heartbreaking to begin with, but there's that extra ping of sadness knowing that Jonathan Larson never lived to see his baby become a critically acclaimed, heavily awarded smash hit.\n\nSo, what are some songs for you that fit in this category?", "score": 53.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/wpg1h2/songs_where_knowing_a_bit_of_background_about_the/", "name": "t3_wpg1h2", "source_subreddit": "popheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["The Jets", "Britney Spears", "Rupert Holmes", "Yes", "Jonathan Larson"], "albums": ["Rent"], "songs": ["You Got it All", "The Pina Colada Song"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Praying", "Petals", "Closest to me", "ghostin'", "*thank u", "next*", "Drops of Jupiter", "Tears in Heaven", "Confessions of a Broken Heart", "Together Again", "Because of You", "So Long Frank Lloyd Wright", "The Only Living Boy in New York", "No Love.

{"query": "harmonic or contrapuntal innovations, or for their overall unconventionality, within Johann Sebastian Bach's extensive catalog, especially considering the context of his time and the challenges of understanding and appreciating complex counterpoint?\" Rewritten Question: Considering the historical context of Johann Sebastian Bach's time and the challenges of appreciating complex counterpoint, what are some of your favorite works within his extensive catalog that stand out for their harmonic or contrapuntal innovations, or for their overall unconventionality, particularly focusing on pieces like *The Art of Fugue* BWV 1080 (noted for its harmonic instability and perceived tonal development reaching Wagner and Berg), the *Keyboard Concerto No. 1 in D minor*, the fugues within *The Well-Tempered Clavier*, and the *Toccata in F-sharp minor* BWV 910 (described as having profound and distinct harmonic language, and often performed contemplatively by Glenn Gould)", "combined_text": "What were some of JS Bach's \"strangest\" or most unconventional works? Of course, his music during his time was very offsetting to people, being compositionally centuries ahead of its time. Fugues were just not popular, owing to how much skill it actually takes to understand one and how much focus you must have the whole way through to hear the counterpoint clearly.\n\nI would think that his last work, The Art of Fugue BWV 1080, could be considered one of his strangest or most unconventional works just in the sense that it is harmonically set apart from the rest in his work. To paraphrase what Glenn Gould has said [in one of his documentaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uze5TfNByyY), the pieces within BWV 1080 seem to never really stay in one key center and instead keep pushing farther into tonality, reaching at least to the time of Wagner and even presenting tonal development more advanced than Berg. However, I would argue that a great deal of Bach's pieces reach very far into tonality - though not nearly as much as BWV 1080 - The Art of Fugue just happens to be at one extreme on a spectrum of harmonic \"stability.\" The Keyboard Concerto No. 1 in D minor, for example, is a remarkably advanced piece with all respects to harmony, counterpoint, and form. Many of the fugues in the Well-Tempered Clavier of course display his uncanny ability to produce the most complex contrapuntal interplays as well.\n\nAnother piece I would like to mention is his Toccata in F-sharp minor, BWV 910, whose harmonic language is some of the most profound I've ever heard in all music, and is frankly much different from most Bach I've heard. Gould's rendition really brings out the contemplative, serious, almost mystic nature of the piece. Often, his compositions titled \"toccata\" are freer in form, with tempo changes as continuations of the composition instead of separate movements.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite works that stand out for particular reasons?", "score": 43.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/rlrbyg/what_were_some_of_js_bachs_strangest_or_most/", "name": "t3_rlrbyg", "source_subreddit": "classicalmusic", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["JS Bach"], "songs": ["The Art of Fugue BWV 1080", "Keyboard Concerto No. 1 in D minor", "Toccata in F-sharp minor BWV 910"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["three-part ricercar", "D minor chromatic fantasy and fugue", "C major *Kleine harmonisches Labyrinth*", "Mass in B Minor", "Messiah", "\"fugues\"", "BWV14", "BWV682", "BWV997", "F Minor Tocatta", "O Ewigkeit", "du Donnerwort", "BWV 60", "Sarabande", "Bourrée", "Allemande", "Stairway to Heaven", "Stairway to Heaven", "BWV 936: Sonata in D Major", "BWV 203: Amore traditore", "BWV 212: Peasant Cantata", "Iceberg theory", "BWV 906", "BWV 923", "Chromatic Toccata and Fugue", "The Finished Well-Fugue", "fugues", "BWV14", "Ooh wee 682", "Believer"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_hphwgqu", "score": 34.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Bach", "Wagner", "Berg"], "albums": ["The Musical Offering"], "songs": ["three-part ricercar", "D minor chromatic fantasy and fugue", "C major *Kleine harmonisches Labyrinth*"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpied8n", "score": 14.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Bach"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Mass in B Minor"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpi8vtq", "score": 12.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Handel"], "albums": ["Royal Offering"], "songs": ["Messiah", "\"fugues\""]}}, {"name": "t1_hphrsi2", "score": 11.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Johann Sebastian Bach"], "albums": ["German Organ Mass"], "songs": ["BWV14", "BWV682", "BWV997", "F Minor Tocatta"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpix475", "score": 6.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Berg"], "albums": [], "songs": ["O Ewigkeit", "du Donnerwort", "BWV 60"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpjai1v", "score": 4.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Sarabande", "Bourrée", "Allemande"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpist4m", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": ["The Musical Offering"], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpiyc65", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpr12ay", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Bach"], "albums": [], "songs": ["BWV 936: Sonata in D Major", "BWV 203: Amore traditore", "BWV 212: Peasant Cantata"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpie3tk", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Iceberg theory"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpjny5i", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Johann Sebastian Bach"], "albums": [], "songs": ["BWV 906", "BWV 923"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpk89tn", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Bach", "JS Bach", "CPE Bach"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Chromatic Toccata and Fugue", "The Finished Well-Fugue"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpkta3h", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Bach"], "albums": [], "songs": ["fugues"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpixp23", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Johann Sebastian Bach"], "albums": ["The Art of Fugue"], "songs": ["BWV14"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpjatsy", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Ooh wee 682"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpr0g99", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_hpyqvl0", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Johann Sebastian Bach"], "albums": [], "songs": ["His Wedding Quodlibet", "BWV 524"]}}, {"name": "t1_hx0x3zx", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Johann Sebastian Bach", "Samuil Feinberg"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Agnus Dei from mass in B-minor (BWV 232)", "fugue of BWV 904 in A-minor", "fugue of BWV 869 in B-minor", "Goldberg-Variation no. 15 (BWV 988)"]}}], "bucket": "other"}

What are some of the best examples classical music usage in movies?\n\nObviously one has to include Stanley Kubrick and his masterful musical selection for the scores and soundtracks of his films. Amongst his most interesting, intense and revolutionary selections include:\n\" Also Sprach Zarathustra\" by Richard Strauss in his 1968 epic: \" 2001: A Space Odyssey\". The entire soundtrack of \"Barry Lyndon,\" is as flawless as they come, with Bach, Schubert, Mozart, and of course Handel.\n\nMartin Scorsese has some great selections as well, most notably in my opinion in his 2010 \"Shutter Island,\" the scenes in which Mahler's quarter plays dramatically while he displays powerful images, brings me to tears almost.\n\n\"Philadelphia\" has an amazing, moving scene in which Tom Hanks dramatically describes \"La mamma morta,\" as sung by Maria Callas to Denzel Washington, which frankly is as moving a scene as there is.

My question today is which of the four is your favorite movement, and why? Here’s the piece if you haven’t heard it: https://youtu.be/RthuLePDo3A\n\nMy favorite movement is movement II: Scherzo. I absolutely love chaos in music, so I enjoy stuff like The Rite of Spring or Give Us This Day, and similar works. But I also love melody, and more precisely, repetition, which is something that a lot of “chaotic” classical pieces lack. In this movement, the same 22 bar phrase repeats over and over, yet never becomes less interesting, and slowly becomes more chaotic. One thing that composers tend to commonly use to get the rowdy and rambunctious feeling is loud brass melody, which this movement does. But to give it that extra push into shredding chaos is near constant fast triplets in the winds/strings. Then, when the melody finally shifts to trombone, then horn, and slowly growing to the whole brass section, it just sends shivers down my spine every time I hear it. Then it switches to winds and ooooohhhhh that fast bassoon stuff is what I live for. And it wraps all up by ending nicely in pianissimo, which isn’t what anyone was expecting. It’s just so satisfying to listen to, I think I’m addicted. Also, as a tuba player myself, I appreciate how much Hindemith uses the tuba compared to other composers, and in this movement, the tuba has a fast melody line below the rest of the brass all to itself during the B section. And I must say, it feels good to be important.\n\nNow what do you guys think?", "score": 10.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/gf15rt/one_of_my_favorite_orchestra_pieces_of_all_time/", "name": "t3_gf15rt", "source_subreddit": "classicalmusic", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Paul Hindemith"], "songs": ["Symphonic Metamorphosis", "The Rite of Spring", "Give Us This Day"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["4 3", "2"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_hizcle2", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["4 3", "2"]}}], "bucket": "music"}

{"query": "like it. **Join the discussion!**\" ## Generated Question: Considering Lil Durk's significant influence on the Drill genre, alongside other artists like Chief Keef, and given the tape's notable use of autotune to create a \"subhuman\" and \"harsher\" sound while narrating \"gritty tales on life,\" as highlighted in tracks like \"Traumatized\" and \"Dis Ain't What You Want\" from the 2013 album *Signed to The Streets*, how does this listening club, led by /u/StillFreeAudioTwo, intend to critically analyze and discuss the album's strengths, such as its \"gritty paranoia\" and \"bitter insults,\" while avoiding vague praise or criticism, and what are members' initial impressions and specific track preferences", "combined_text": "Hip-Hop Listening Club of the Week #173: Lil Durk - Signed to The Streets **Welcome to the HHH listening club**\n___________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThis week we'll be listening to **[Lil Durk](http://i.imgur.com/zTBYqQ1.png) - [Signed To The Streets](http://i.imgur.com/n0k0ThA.png)**\n\n\nA little info on the tape:\n\n&gt;The reason I chose this is that it was one of the essential tapes that brought me into the Drill genre and Durk is one of the main artists I admire in the genre. The others being [Back From The Dead](http://www.datpiff.com/Chief-Keef-Back-From-The-Dead-mixtape.324584.html), [Free Crack](https://www.audiomack.com/album/rapxclusive/free-crack-1), and [Welcome to Fazoland](http://www.datpiff.com/Lil-Herb-Welcome-to-Fazoland-NO-DJ-mixtape.597798.html). \n\n&gt;However, this tape really sticks out for me due to the use of autotune. Many people say autotune doesn't work in rap, it's been overdone, and while that is true at times, Durk is an exception. He makes the tuning work to sound subhuman and somehow even harsher while relating gritty tales on life. Chief Keef does it good as well, at times, but this tape excludes him. \n\n&gt;With great hooks on [Traumatized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkekeADB8Z4) and [Dis Ain't What You Want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgA-wVkuZGo) (whole tape really), gritty paranoia with [Who is This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv1ns8R0xA4), bitter insults and harshness all around, this tape shows Durk as a rough yet intriguing savage in Chiraq.\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Selector**: /u/StillFreeAudioTwo\n\n**Tape:** Lil Durk - Signed to The Streets (2013)\n\n**Stream/Download:**\n\n* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kav6aOck-44)\n\n* [Datpiff](http://www.datpiff.com/Lil-Durk-Signed-To-The-Streets-mixtape.515989.html)\n\n\n**Guidelines**\n\nThis is an open thread for you to share your thoughts on the album. **Avoid vague statements of praise or criticism.** This is **your chance to practice being a critic.**\n\n*It's fine for you to drop by just to say you love the album, but let's try and step it up a bit!!!*\n\n\nWHY do you like this tape?

In the lane thug's in, it feels like the sound has really become stale and no ones evolving so it's great to see Thug continue to stand out from his peers and experiment 10+ years into his career. While I do not consider Punk in the upper half of his discography, I still think it's a great project.\n\nOnly two songs I don't consider good songs are Icy Hot (what a waste of a collaboration with Doja Cat) and Livin It Up w/ Post Malone and ASAP Rocky - both songs clearly aiming for streams and breaking away from the \" Punk \" theme. I unfortunately still have gripes with the super rough mixing throughout the project. People around thug have said that there was a final mix version but thug wanted it to sound more \" down to earth \" and re-did all the mixing to sound more rough. Wish we got both versions.\n\nThe best songs on the album are definitely still the ones he [performed live in his Tiny Desk performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAROJPnd_s8) though. Shoutout to Contagious though, that song is fantastic and a lot of the lyrics hit even harder after the YSL RICO case.\n\nMy favorite feature surprisingly (due to the amount of superstars on this project) goes to be his signee T-Shyne  on the song Stressed with J.

Though unofficial, this mixtape is a great sampler of his massive catalog: http://www.datpiff.com/DZK-How-I-Get-Down-mixtape.194520.html\n\nHe also has a PHENOMENAL mixtape called The Intertainer: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA52E58D0C42EBE1A\n\nHere are some personal favorite tracks that show his range of styles:\n\n**MAN POSSESSED** - Dark, story telling track, a la Dance With The Devil:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_8QeyjIgFQ\n\n**HOW I GET DOWN** - A good intro to what DZ is all about\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxp7habAov0\n\n\n**TORCHER** - Intense lyrical showmanship:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5seea-uXPg\n\n**HUSTLE HARD** -  A dope gangster-rap-inspired hype track\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T2Hc76cFtI\n\n**BOW DOWN** - A critical look at religion:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21J4q6DxcyQ\n\n\n\n", "score": 18.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/27xih3/an_intro_to_dzk_once_one_of_the_most_hyped/", "name": "t3_27xih3", "source_subreddit": "hiphopheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["DZK", "Canibus", "DJ QBert", "Shadowville"], "albums": ["The Intertainer"], "songs": ["MAN POSSESSED", "HOW I GET DOWN", "TORCHER", "HUSTLE HARD", "BOW DOWN"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Man Possessed", "How I Get Down", "High School Girls", "Torcher song", "Check this song out too", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Air Strike", "Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_ci5ckco", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Jesus", "Fergie", "unknown artist mentioned"], "albums": ["How I Get Down mixtape"], "songs": ["Man Possessed", "How I Get Down"]}}, {"name": "t1_ci5cnlk", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["High School Girls"]}}, {"name": "t1_ci5j55n", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Eminem", "D12", "Canibus", "DZK"], "albums": ["Canibus album"], "songs": ["Torcher song"]}}, {"name": "t1_ci5cr8y", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["HHH", "Super Zeros", "Revenge of Xenu"], "albums": ["Datpiff tape"], "songs": ["Check this song out too"]}}, {"name": "t1_cieqtue", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_cieqwhr", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_cieu744", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Canibus", "D12", "DZK", "Bizarre"], "albums": ["Melatonin Magik"], "songs": ["Air Strike"]}}, {"name": "t1_cifehs6", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}], "bucket": "pop_culture"}

Drake, why has this seemingly generic and repetitive element become so widespread in the genre, and does anyone else find it indicative of a decline in creativity within mainstream hip hop", "combined_text": "On the \"Hey\" chant in mainstream hip hop songs. This has been bugging me for awhile so I thought I would share my feelings. This only applies to the poppy, clubby, mainstream brand of hip hop, and I might be looking too much into it. But here I go: Does anyone else hate that incessant \"hey hey hey hey\" chant thats on so many hip hop beats nowadays? I find it very trite. For example, I drove home from a friends house right now and I had a local top 40 station playing on the radio, and four of the five songs that I heard on my drive included this chant. These are the songs as follows:  \n  \nParanoid by Ty Dolla $ign ft. B.o.B (not that terrible, but overall just kinda meh)  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC2ZgCEaLWs  \n  \nFancy by Iggy Azalea (I get that Iggy Azalea is pretty big right now but I honestly don't see her having any kind of longevity for a long term music career)  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-zpOMYRi0w  \n  \nMain Chick by Kid Ink ft. Chris Brown (absolute trash)  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqfmMGm57vw  \n  \nWho Do You Love? YG ft. Drake (even worse)   \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN4upVaDFFs  \n  \nI don't get it. Is this what the people want? Has mainstream hip hop hit a complete nadir in terms of creativity? I understand that you don't listen to this subgenre of hip hop when you want to feel enlightened or have some knowledge dropped, but  shit, I mean, I almost felt like the radio station was trolling me for a second there. It sounds so generic. Any thoughts? \n\nEDIT: Just found this on Youtube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES03SQyU_2o\n\nEDIT 2: After listening again, it sounds a little more like an \"ay ay ay ay\" as opposed to a \"hey hey hey hey.\" I don't know.\n\n\n\n\n", "score": 0.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/2b108u/on_the_hey_chant_in_mainstream_hip_hop_songs/", "name": "t3_2b108u", "source_subreddit": "hiphopheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Ty Dolla $ign ft.
