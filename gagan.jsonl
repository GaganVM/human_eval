So far they only have one tape out, Bastards of the Party, but a collective within the collective, Children of the Night (Remy Banks, Nasty Nigel, Lansky Jones) also has a tape. If you're a fan of any of the Beast Coast stuff then you will more than likely love World's Fair. Once thing that sticks out about them is that each member does a good job of distinguishing themselves, which is kinda the opposite of Pro Era and a problem some people have with them. Biggest downside to them is that they don't have much work out yet but hopefully that will change.

Long story short, they were absolutely awesome. \n\nThe best part, really, was that Papa Emeritus wasn't the only thing to watch on stage. The rest of the band has a ton of energy and *synergy* that made it amazing to behold.\n\n[Pic of the stage](http://i.imgur.com/xI1t1mv.jpg)\n\n(Note, I was not one of those people filming the whole show or taking pics the whole time.

There's also rumours of the two of them being in the studio with a project either on So Help Me God or Skepta's upcoming album Konnichiwa. Drake has also stated his love for Skepta, Sneakbo and one of the legends of the game, Wiley. But I wouldn't take his endorsements too seriously lol.\n\nAs this sub is predominately Americans, I was wondering what you guys felt about the UK scene and whether it would be successful overseas. I think Kanye's approval will do wonders as the Grime scene is still associated with thug culture over here by the masses. But these guys have been putting on shows for years, selling mixtapes from their cars, not making music for the p but for the love of it. That's what hip-hop is about to me and almost all these guys have come from the gutter. That's why I hope and believe American hip-hop fans will appreciate our upcoming genre.\n\nApologies if this has been discussed before, I'm a relatively new sub. I'll post some links below of a few popular songs and sources for music if you want to see what Grime is really about, hopefully others will add more cause I'm only scratching the surface!\n\nPeace and love.\n\n[Skepta - Shutdown](https://soundcloud.com/skepta/shutdown)\n\n[Skepta - It Ain't Safe feat.

{"query": "forgotten. Given the recent passing of Ronnie Spector and the renewed interest in her music, what are some recommended tracks or albums beyond *Be My Baby* and *Sleigh Ride* that showcase her powerful voice and significant industry respect, particularly considering her collaborations and the context of songs like *Walking in the Rain*, *I Wish I Never Saw the Sunshine*, *Try Some, Buy Some* (written by George Harrison during her abusive marriage), *Say Goodbye to Hollywood* (with Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band), *Take Me Home Tonight* (featuring an interpolation of *Be My Baby*), and *She Talks to Rainbows*, and which of her works best demonstrate why she should be considered alongside artists like Diana Ross and Dusty Springfield?\"", "combined_text": "Ronnie Spector: let's do a deep dive Before Ronnie Spector's death earlier this week my knowledge of her didn't extend far beyond *Be My Baby* and *Sleigh Ride*, but the stature of those tracks meant I held The Ronettes in high regard. The coverage of her life encouraged me to listen to more of her discography, however, and I'm very glad I did. Ronnie had a wonderful voice, and it's clear from her collaborations that she was hugely respected within the industry.\n\nI'd be interested to know if anyone else has listened to Ronnie over the last few days, and if you have any pointers about what to listen to.\n\nFrom my limited exploration I can recommend the following:\n\n* [***Walking in the Rain***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l5t1FUscUI) — a brooding track from the Ronette days featuring Ronnie's huge voice.\n* [***I Wish I Never Saw the Sunshine***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtEmjwI2a7Q) — another great example of how her voice could soar over anything put in its way.\n* [***Try Some, Buy Some***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeWnxY5Uyn4) — Penned by George Harrison, this troubled record was created during Ronnie's abusive marriage to Phil Spector. Despite this she gave a magnificent performance.\n* [***Say Goodbye to Hollywood***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ72eejEcTQ) — a thumping Billy Joel cover recorded with Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band.\n* [***Take Me Home Tonight***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aJvIFK9-xk) — Eddie Money's conventional 80s pop rock track is elevated hugely when Ronnie appears to interpolate *Be My Baby*. Her slow reveal in the video teases the appearance of an icon perfectly.\n* [***She Talks to Rainbows***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2Y0jCadQmw) — a Ramones cover that makes you yearn for a full album of original rock material.\n\nI've barely scratched the surface, yet it's clear to me that Ronnie Spector should be held in the same individual regard as Diana Ross, Dusty Springfield, or any of her peers. She deserved solo success, and it's a great shame that despite releasing several great singles it never came her way. Still, the popularity of The Ronettes means it's unlikely Ronnie and her voice will ever be forgotten, thank goodness.\n\nEdit: thank you for the gold, whoever you are!", "score": 104.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/s5pbhk/ronnie_spector_lets_do_a_deep_dive/", "name": "t3_s5pbhk", "source_subreddit": "popheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Ronnie Spector", "Phil Spector", "George Harrison", "Bruce Springsteen", "Eddie Money", "Billy Joel", "Diana Ross", "Dusty Springfield", "The Ramones", "The Ronettes"], "songs": ["Walking in the Rain", "I Wish I Never Saw the Sunshine", "Try Some", "Buy Some", "Say Goodbye to Hollywood", "Take Me Home Tonight", "She Talks to Rainbows"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Why Don't They Let Us Fall In Love", "Be My Baby", "Ugh love her", "That You", "Be My Baby", "\"Lose It!\""]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_ht141x7", "score": 8.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Ronnie", "The Ronettes", "Veronica", "Phil Spector"], "albums": ["Presenting The Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica", "The Early Years", "The Ronettes Featuring Veronica"], "songs": ["Why Don't They Let Us Fall In Love"]}}, {"name": "t1_ht1ca0s", "score": 8.0, "entities": {"artists": ["The Ronettes", "Ronnie Spector"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Be My Baby"]}}, {"name": "t1_ht0qh3z", "score": 7.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Ugh love her"]}}, {"name": "t1_ht2bmcs", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Brian Wilson"], "albums": [], "songs": ["That You"]}}, {"name": "t1_ht2brkg", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["The Ronettes"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Be My Baby"]}}, {"name": "t1_ht2c4u6", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["\"Lose It!\""]}}], "bucket": "other"}

{"query": "Why do composers like Tchaikovsky (Piano Concerto No. 1, First Movement), Saint-Saëns (Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso), and Chopin (Ballade No. 4) sometimes employ introductions or initial moods that seemingly disappear or are only briefly revisited later in the piece (e.g., Tchaikovsky at 3:25, Saint-Saëns after 1:55, and Chopin initially from 0:00-0:25, with a later return at 6:03), and what are the intended effects of this structural choice on the listener's experience, particularly when those initial sections are favored by the listener over the subsequent development of the piece", "combined_text": "What's your opinion on introductions that don't return later in the piece? There's probably a technical term and reason for it, but some pieces have an introduction that either never returns later in the piece or a mood in the introduction that never really comes back.\n\nMy examples: \n\n[Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1, First Movement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWerj8FcprM) - Dat intro.  Then after 3:25, it becomes some sort of folk dance-y type thing.  Where's dat intro again? \n\n[Saint-Saëns Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_and_Rondo_Capriccioso#Style_and_structure) -  From 0:00 to 1:55 it's sort of slow, sometimes faster, meditative.  After 1:55, well, it's fast and Spanish. \n\n[Chopin Ballade No. 4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tmQSWuYwrI) - This one some people might not agree with me, but the mood from 0:00 to 0:25 for me never really comes back again in the rest of the piece.  And arguably the main melody starts in 0:25.  But I love that bit from 0:00 to 0:25.  It's kind of cheesy and doesn't have the intensity of the rest of the piece, and ~~it never comes back~~ comes back once at 6:03 (thanks to /u/deftius).  \n\nI bet close musical analysis could uncover where the intro parts do creep back up in the rest of the piece, but... I don't know if that matters, at least to me.  Like, to be honest, for the Tchaikovsky and Chopin examples, the intros are my favorite parts of that song.  For the Saint-Saëns part, I think the two parts could have been two separate songs with the Introduction developed a lot more on its own.

SAMIYAM's beats have a lot of groove that can be attributed to the off tempo drumming that FlyLo and Dilla are known for.

Hey all, \n\nSo a couple weeks ago I attended one of Arcade Fire's amazing Reflektor concerts, and [I loved it.](http://dozensofdonuts.blogspot.com/2014/09/arcade-fire-reflektor-tour-mansfield-ma.html) Anyways, as many of you who have gone know Dan Deacon was one of the openers. I had heard his name but never got into his music, didn't even know what he sounded like to be honest. Well, the first song starts playing and then a beat unlike anything I've ever heard blows through the speakers. I was immediately floored and knew I had to find out more. That track was [Of The Mountains.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRw2o-0c8GA) \n\nI then got Bromst, his 'second' album (not really sure, his discography is rather sporadic) and instantly fell in love with the album after hearing the opener, [Build Voice.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8NOr47onjk) Nearly every song on [Bromst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8NOr47onjk&amp;list=PL7FA8C2D1B56E0A4F) is amazing in their own ways. And while I still enjoy that album the most and think it's his best, his previous effort, Spiderman Of The Rings, has some incredible songs as well. The standout is easily the 12 minute opus [Wham City.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlvA1GMBzW8) His latest release, America, while not my favorite, has a couple stellar songs too, including [USA Part 1: Is A Monster.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeVXpRbRUf4)\n\nHis brand of electronic dance is unlike any I've heard before, as nearly every song, at least the climatic moments of many, are turned up to 11, as extremely hyper-realistic, rave-influenced, out-of-body experiences that make your brain go hay-wire.

Dropping jewels.\n\n&gt;Came from the kid off the corner\n\n&gt;How I lived ain't no telling what I did in my former\n\n___\n[**We Movin'** \\(Produced by Statik Selektah\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPZ5MmsGdfs#t=17)\n\n____\n\nThe first single to *Do or Die II* . No real budget to it but lots of classic bars all over it.\n\n&gt;I'm too ahead of my time to be a has-been\n\n___\n\n[**Echo Park** \\(Prod. by DJ Doo Wop\\)](https://soundcloud.com/djdoowop/doo-wop-az-echo-park)\n\n___\n\nJackson 5 and Thin Lizzy samples. Boom bap revival. Sounds like they recorded it in the park.\n\n___\n\n[**Red Magic**](https://soundcloud.com/quietmoneyrecs/red-magic)\n\n____\n\nSo as you can probably tell, dude seems to be pretty low budget. Put him on some fire production like this and it really comes together. Since he says *Do' or Die II* will be his last album, we should expect material of this caliber. Two calls to Nas in this one:\n\n&gt;Years before Nas released and his tape leaked\n\n&gt;I was right there in Chesapeake like 8 deep for 80 weeks\n\nThen one about Life's a Bitch.\n\n&gt;A crook off a verse and a hook\n\n____\n", "score": 125.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/29iaku/what_az_has_been_up_to/", "name": "t3_29iaku", "source_subreddit": "hiphopheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["AZ", "Cormega", "Kool G Rap", "Nas"], "albums": ["Do or Die II", "Red Magic"], "songs": ["Murda on the Daily", "Animal", "This Is What I Do", "I Excel", "We Movin'", "Echo Park"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Stairway to Heaven", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Stairway to Heaven", "Doe or Die", "Stairway to Heaven", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_cil9d69", "score": 14.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cilar3a", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_cilbw5y", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cildxce", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["AZ", "NYrap"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Doe or Die"]}}, {"name": "t1_cile6qi", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cilouo2", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_cilovut", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_cil6a97", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}], "bucket": "other"}

My favorite vocals by Tiffany are from Girlicious' debut single [Like Me](https://youtu.be/LE3ZEPSW1j8?t=120). \n\nMore recently, I noticed I am very fond of Megan Thee Stallion's adlibs too. Her freestyle for [Bless The Booth by DJ Booth](https://youtu.be/tHpugicIkBU?t=109) that was officially released in Something For Thee Hotties is impeccable for me in that same sense. \n\nWhat are some of yours favorites?", "score": 50.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/vkhefz/what_are_some_of_your_favorite_vocals_runs_or/", "name": "t3_vkhefz", "source_subreddit":

{"query": "'m largely ignorant.\" ``` What classical music pieces, beyond works by Charles Ives (The Unanswered Question), Richard Wagner (specifically the Tristan chord), Max Richter (particularly November), and Carter Burwell (especially the \"Canada\" cue from the film *A Serious Man*), explore themes of striving for a deeper understanding or connection without necessarily achieving a definitive resolution, reflecting a sense of the transcendent through questioning and unresolved tension, and potentially influenced by philosophical concepts like Schopenhauer, while also encompassing a range of styles from avant-garde to more accessible compositions? ```", "combined_text": "Can you recommend music that grapples with the transcendent? Denizens of /r/classicalmusic, I wonder if you can help me expand my knowledge/appreciation/collection of music that strikes a rather particular note. First, I should hold my hands up and say that when it comes to classical music, I'm one of those modern philistines whose paper-thin knowledge comes from tracing back the influences of film composers, more than from any deeper understanding of the classical bedrock.\n\nIf you'll forgive some woolly liberal-arts blather, the type of music I'm looking for is that which captures the striving for a deeper understanding/connection/etc but without necessarily arriving at it (ie not the resplendently beautiful Miserere). A good example would be **Charles Ives**'s [The Unanswered Question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trkFgIMC-Ks), which gets at the idea that accepting the infinite possibility for questioning offers its own sort of transcendence. However, I'm not necessarily only looking for super avant garde stuff — **Wagner**'s Schopenhauer-influenced [Tristan chord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpWg_cZkDho) (even if it ultimately, gloriously resolves) feels like the other side of the same coin. \n\nEqually, I'm also interested in composers who have followed those threads and are happy to let their music soar as it looks for a resolution that never quite arrives, which I find a lot in **Max Richter**'s work (for example, [November](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Bb0k9HgQxc), with its churning solo violin that suggests a kinship with Ives's furious woodwinds). Or in my more familiar backyard of film scores, **Carter Burwell**'s wonderful music for the Coen Brothers' *A Serious Man* (for example, [Canada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IvNOF4O4Po), for which I link to a clip from the film because the only version of the soundtrack on youtube has horribly clipped levels).\n  \n  \nThank you in advance for indulging such a long-winded request.

{"query": "Considering someone is looking to get into Jay Electronica's music and was initially drawn in by the track \"Eternal Sunshine,\" and recently reignited their interest after attending a 60-90 minute London concert, what is the tracklist of this curated 20-track mixtape, designed to showcase Jay Electronica's most \"polished\" and fully-fleshed out songs, excluding tracks 3 (\"Exhibit A\") and 16 (\"Exhibit C\") due to HHH guidelines, and which offers a selection mirroring the songs performed live at the concert", "combined_text": "[MIXTAPE] Want to get into Jay Electronica? I made a compilation of his best tracks to date. Hey, fam. Back in 2013 I became really intrigued and obsessed with Jay Electronica after stumbling across his 'Eternal Sunshine' track, and sequenced myself a little collection of what I thought were his best tracks at the time. Fast forward to this year, I ended up going to [his London gig](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/2z4can/jay_electronica_gig_in_london_last_night_14th/) because a kind-hearted HHH homie had a spare ticket. Suffice to say... It's kinda resparked the obsession.\n\nI ended up revising the collection I made with a lot more tracks and a rejigged order.The main difference between this one and the other mixtapes out there is I tried to make it much more focused - this one contains 20 tracks instead of 40+, and it's the tracks from Jay that I think are the most \"polished\" and fully-fleshed out. When I finished sequencing it, I realized it included all the songs Jay performed in his 60-90 minute set, so I think that's a good sign this covers pretty much all the tracks you need to know about!\n________________________________________________________\nAnyway, here it is!

{"query": "Considering the Indie music community, why haven't bands like The Folk Implosion (featuring Lou Barlow of Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh), particularly known for songs like \"One Part Lullaby\" and \"Natural One\" (the latter featured in the film *Kids*), and their album *One Part Lullaby*, received more recognition and praise despite their quality, especially when compared to the work of Barlow's other bands", "combined_text": "Your Favorite Band (That Nobody Here Talks About) We all have those bands that we love like children, despite not ever having a chance to talk about them with anybody. And I don't mean the ones that just don't get *enough* chatter (I know we all feel that about certain bands), I mean the kinds of bands you've *never* seen talked about here.  \n  \nHere, dear Indieheads, is your chance to rave about those bands. I'll start:  \n  \n**The Folk Implosion**  \nSongs: [\"One Part Lullaby\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_3e5dyqaok), [\"Natural One\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0FT-5JLCAY)  \n  \nIf you've heard The Folk Implosion before, chances are it's because of \"Natural One\", which was on the soundtrack to Harmony Korine's *Kids*. Despite being a side-project of Lou Barlow of Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh, they never got the same amount of praise as those bands. Their album *One Part Lullaby* is, to this day, one of my very favorite warm weather/summertime records. They should be as beloved as anything the Dino boys ever did, but they are largely forgotten and unmissed, and I'll never understand why.

{"query": "Considering my deep appreciation for the lush, decadent, and emotionally powerful soundscapes of late Romantic composers like Wagner, Liszt, Mahler, and Strauss, extending to early Schoenberg (specifically *Gurrelieder*), and with a particular fondness for pieces like Wagner's *Tristan* prelude, Liszt's \"Es muss ein Wunderbares sein,\" Schoenberg's *Gurrelieder*, Mahler's Symphony No. 6 (Andante), and recognizing that I enjoy both Brahms/Schumann and later modernists like Stravinsky, what other Austro-German composers, beyond those already mentioned, created similarly romantic and sensual music capable of evoking a comparable sense of awe and emotional intensity", "combined_text": "Recommendations for late Romantic era composers with lush, decadent, Wagnerian/Mahlerian sound (e.g. Wagner, Lizst, Mahler, Strauss, etc.)? Hey! My favourite era/style of classical music is the late romantic era, specifically the tradition from Wagner extending to Mahler and early Schoenberg (i.e. Gurrelieder)-unsurprising since Wagner and Mahler are my all-time favourite along with Bach. \n\nMy problem is it's so hard to find composers who wrote in this style, especially in the Austro-German tradition, with most composers seeming to be either on the side of the rather more throwback style of Brahms and Schumann or modernism (Schoenberg, Stravinsky), both of which I love but nearly as much as the one in between the two. There's just nothing that can give me goose bumps like Wagner and Mahler and would love to find other composers who wrote similar things, particularly their more romantic, sensual sounding music.\n\nExamples:\n\nTristan prelude, Wagner: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l25J7xdhhKc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l25J7xdhhKc)\n\n\"Es muss ein Wunderbares sein\", song, Lizst: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpK9irt0u9M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpK9irt0u9M)\n\nGurrelieder, cantata, Schoenberg (honestly listen to the whole thing, it's huge, but just a masterpiece): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qahTc253qZU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qahTc253qZU)\n\nSymphony 6, Andante, Mahler: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvUego50gVg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvUego50gVg)", "score": 5.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/mh6opy/recommendations_for_late_romantic_era_composers/", "name": "t3_mh6opy", "source_subreddit": "classicalmusic", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Wagner", "Liszt", "Mahler", "Strauss", "Schoenberg", "Bach"], "albums": ["Gurrelieder"], "songs": ["Tristan prelude", "\"Es Muss Ein Wunderbares Sein\"", "Symphony 6", "Andante"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Pelleas und Melisande Op. 5", "love theme", "Three Orchestral Pieces", "Gezeichneten", "Birthday of the Infanta", "Chamber Symphony", "Ferne Klange", "Die Seejungfrau", "Lyric Suite", "Stairway to Heaven", "True", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "It's Quiet Here", "Oh my field", "Vocalise", "Karajan/BPO recording", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Stairway to Heaven", "Believer"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_gsx05wt", "score": 4.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Schoenberg", "Berg"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Pelleas und Melisande Op. 5", "love theme", "Three Orchestral Pieces"]}}, {"name": "t1_gsxe5bl", "score": 4.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Schreker"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Gezeichneten", "Birthday of the Infanta", "Chamber Symphony", "Ferne Klange"]}}, {"name": "t1_gsx323s", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Alexander Zemlinsky"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Die Seejungfrau"]}}, {"name": "t1_gsy2bpb", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Bruckner", "Richard Strauss", "Pfitzner", "Franz Schmidt", "Reger", "Zemlinsky", "Schoenberg", "Webern", "Berg"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Lyric Suite"]}}, {"name": "t1_gsxmg19", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Erich Wolfgang Korngold"], "albums": ["Die tote Stadt"], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_gsymb2u", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["True"]}}, {"name": "t1_gsze7xe", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_gsx7du4", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_gsxdhhn", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Joseph Marx", "Bortkiewicz", "Liszt", "Rach", "Gryaznov"], "albums": [], "songs": ["It's Quiet Here", "Oh my field", "Vocalise"]}}, {"name": "t1_gsy3bwu", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Karajan/BPO recording"]}}, {"name": "t1_gsymdtt", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_gt1d3pl", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Berg", "Led Zeppelin", "Pink Floyd"], "albums": ["Dark Side of the Moon"], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven", "Believer"]}}], "bucket": "music"}

{"query": "What other songs, beyond \"Jesus Take The Wheel,\" \"Just A Dream,\" and \"Church Bells\" by Carrie Underwood, utilize a central image or phrase that significantly shifts in meaning as the song progresses, often involving a narrative twist or recontextualization within a relatively short runtime and employing repetition to highlight this change", "combined_text": "Songs where the central image/phrase changes meaning as the song progresses? So in the DD I was talking about how I think [\"Jesus Take The Wheel\" by Carrie Underwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lydBPm2KRaU) gets a bad reputation as a meme song because the chorus is kinda strange, but it makes perfect sense in context: the woman in the song is praying to Jesus to save her and her baby as her car spins out after hitting a patch of black ice. The near death experience inspires her to reevaluate her choices and so she sings the chorus again as she asks Jesus to \"take the wheel\" of her life to help her get back on track.\n\nSo then someone brought up another Carrie Underwood song, [\"Just A Dream,\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLntFKtR66g) and I realized it kinda followed a similar format: the first time we hear the phrase \"this is just a dream\" it's about the woman in the song being excited over her wedding, but then when it comes back later she's saying it at her husband's funeral. Another Carrie Underwood song, [\"Church Bells,\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2-yVryNjUM) pulls the same schtick too and even uses the same wedding bells -&gt; funeral bells image.\n\nI love it when a song flips itself on its head like that, it's such a cool storytelling device and one that's uniquely suited to usage in songs given their short runtime and how they use repetition. \n\nWhat are some other songs that make good usage of this trick?", "score": 26.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/s8of39/songs_where_the_central_imagephrase_changes/", "name": "t3_s8of39", "source_subreddit": "popheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Carrie Underwood"], "songs": ["Jesus Take The Wheel", "Just A Dream", "Church Bells"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Blue Bannisters", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Don’t Take the Girl", "no body", "no crime", "Stairway to Heaven", "do you…", "Champagne Problems", "The Lucky One", "\"oh he went there", "okay werk\""]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_hthsnzl", "score": 17.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Lana"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Blue Bannisters"]}}, {"name": "t1_hti7l9q", "score": 13.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_htihfhk", "score": 9.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Tim McGraw"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Don’t Take the Girl"]}}, {"name": "t1_htkbc9u", "score": 9.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Taylor"], "albums": [], "songs": ["no body", "no crime"]}}, {"name": "t1_htigph3", "score": 5.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_htjnyua", "score": 4.0, "entities": {"artists": ["miguel"], "albums": [], "songs": ["do you…"]}}, {"name": "t1_htkbppe", "score": 4.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Post Malone", "Swae Lee"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Champagne Problems"]}}, {"name": "t1_htifiyo", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Taylor Swift"], "albums": [], "songs": ["The Lucky One"]}}, {"name": "t1_htjyxzs", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["\"oh he went there", "okay werk\""]}}], "bucket": "music"}

{"query": "Considering the profound emotional impact (nostalgic, menacing, tormented, parossistic, intoxicating, tragic, ecstatic) experienced from Alban Berg's Piano Sonata and Violin Concerto, and a similar shift in perspective after actively listening to Schoenberg's *Transfigured Night*, what other atonal or \"not-quite-atonal\" classical works, particularly those composed in the early 20th century, might offer a similarly compelling and powerful harmonic language despite lacking traditional modality, and potentially avoiding the previously experienced aversion to composers like Stravinsky, Ligeti, or Shostakovich (beyond his second and third piano concerti)", "combined_text": "Most beautiful atonal/less tonal works? As far as atonal classical music goes, the only two pieces I can think of hearing that I enjoyed were Berg's Piano Sonata and Violin Concerto. Upon hearing [Gould's crystal clear rendition of the sonata](https://youtu.be/I_2gGXv3Wss?t=724), I resonated with the writer of the description of that score-video: *I could take to time to describe how much I love this piece and explain how the extremely logical and cerebral climaxes are calculated to create a painfully visceral, tragic and emotional sound, but that'd be pointless, since Gould already did that in the perfect way (rather simply, but effectively):  \"The expansive, pessimistic, and unquestionably ecstatic... Sonata, opus one.\"   This is sadly the only piece written by Berg in the genre. The sounds here are nostalgic, menacing, tormented, parossistic, intoxicating... Surely one of the greatest pieces of piano literature that came out in early 20th Century.*\n\nI think that growing up as someone in classical piano lessons, there was always the idea in the back of my mind that such complex music with little to no modality could be experimented with to create a sensible and powerful harmonic language unlike anything heard in classical music, but I used to even get nauseous at the thought of Stravinsky, Ligeti, Shostakovich, or Prokofiev (with the exception of a few gems like his second and third piano concerti). Even something that was only on the \"brink\" of atonality at the time like Schoenberg's Transfigured Night, was something I had to warm up to. Actively listening to and understanding the aforementioned pieces transformed my perspective on atonality for sure.\n\nWhat are some other great pieces out there that could be considered atonal or are

What are your thoughts? I've enjoyed metal for over a decade, and have more recently been veering towards bands of metal (and associated genres) that I consider to be violent. By this, I mean that metal is an inherently aggressive form of music, but not all metal is violent. For example, when I first started playing guitar, I was drawn to many metal bands because of how technical the music (or guitar work, specifically) was for that matter, but these bands, more often than not, were not violent. What I mean by violent is the music itself having a sense of ass-kicking, hostile urgency that makes you (definitely me) want to go berserk at a show or otherwise.\n\nExamples of songs by bands I enjoy that are aggressive but not violent include:\n\nOpeth- Bleak http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dZmiayXrqg&amp;feature=relmfu\n\nDeath- Crystal Mountain http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zguCFjHyVeM\n\nWolves in the Throne Room- Vastness and Sorrow http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLfLBbSg_Cc\n\nExamples of songs by bands I enjoy that I consider to be violent (some of which have hardcore influences) include:\n\nNails- Conform http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x60Yx1UsVGA\n\nCursed- Night Terrors http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JAuqzo2Zmw\n\nMagrudergrind- Stagnant http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcMQG5pfdGA\n\nPig Destroyer- Cheerleader Corpses (listen to Jennifer as well) [7] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjlSZwCoXDU\n\nEndless Disease- Destroy Your Fucking Life [8] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyLYDOiIP8M\n\nSo, what do you all think?

Can I have some recommendations? I've recently been listening to some great classical music, and I'm not sure where to find more of what I like.

I also am having a love affair with the [main theme from Swan Lake](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ea90L91eZk) (or, at least I think its the main theme), especially [Massell's adaptation in Black Swan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZei2IUQojw).

You can keep submitting them for the record if you'd like, but I feel like I've got my hands quite full now. Thanks!\n\nI've started to listen to Boulezian's (and other's) recommendation, Rachmaninoff's 2nd, and I love it. The local symphony is actually playing it next month so I'm taking my wife. Amadeus mentioned Adagio for Strings, which is actually part of the reason I'm on my classical kick. Our church organist played it and it was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've heard - thanks to my wife for tracking it down. Honey-Badger correctly predicted that Vivaldi's winter would be my favorite of the Four Season, and s/he was correct.

I am a bit of a newcomer when it comes to any classical terminology and whatnot so bear with me.  \n\nMost of the classical music I enjoy now comes mostly from Vivaldi;  I really enjoy a number of his prestos in which the orchestra or solo violinist (for concertos) is just going nuts whizzing away at their instruments.  Summer Presto?  Yes please!  **I really enjoy fast instrumental play, not just in classical but also in other genres** (guitar solos are amazing)\n\n\nHowever one thing I don't like about Baroque music is that a lot of composers tend to have this really flowery dainty stuff going on in their slower works that makes me think of fairies prancing through the forest and such, and I honestly can't enjoy it.  There is also the fact that Baroque tends to sound a little generic.  I remember coming across a quote by another composer that Vivaldi's repertoire was essentially one song written over and over again and I certainly feel that way at times.\n\nDo you guys have any recommendations for ~~songs~~ pieces that have the same sort of intensity and speed but might be outside of the Baroque period?

{"query": "*. Halsey has been very open about her struggles with bipolar disorder, and *Manic* is a deep dive into her experiences with it, and the album is a sonic exploration of the highs and lows of bipolar disorder, a journey through mania and depression. *Manic* is a chaotic, beautiful, and ultimately hopeful album. It's a raw and honest portrayal of mental health struggles, and it's a testament to Halsey's artistry. Halsey's vocal performance is incredible, the production is lush and dynamic, and the lyrics are deeply personal and relatable. It's a pop album, but it's also so much more. It's a complex and nuanced exploration of the human condition. It's a masterpiece. It's a 16-track album released on January 17th, 2020, with an alternate cover, and a tracklist and lyrics available on Genius. A Halsey fan who attended her September 23rd, 2018 concert recalls how they first discovered \"Without Me\" and how it ultimately didn't make the final tracklist of *Manic*, despite its initial success and subsequent commercial disappointment as a follow-up to a #1 single, and how Halsey explained", "combined_text": "AOYT 2020 #1: Halsey - Manic *Too many guys think I'm a concept, or*\n\n*I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive*\n\n*I'm just a fucked up girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind*\n\n*Don't assign me yours*\n\n---\n\n**Artist:** [Halsey](https://www.e-techasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Halsey1-1132x509.png)\n\n**Album:** [Manic](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Halsey-Manic.jpg) | [Alternate Cover](https://images.genius.com/d6ffa8ccacf31604e5d8740c2292e921.1000x1000x1.png)\n\n**Tracklist and Lyrics:** [Genius](https://genius.com/albums/Halsey/Manic)\n\n**Release Date:** [January 17th, 2020](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EOdelXVUwAAxJX3.jpg\n)\n\n**r/popheads  [FRESH] Thread:** [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/epskha/halsey_manic/) \n\n**Listen:** \n[Album Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evO8pDoFSA0) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/manic/1479627997) | [Spotify]( https://open.spotify.com/album/68enXe5XcJdciSDAZr0Alr?si=r6_scseJTJSlJ9aKEKs-eA) | [YouTube]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7FaMmsU8PI&amp;list=PLzbGLskt3hhkIFfJYCam6Ro3cp3PrmNxn) \n\n---\n\nLet me take you all the way back to September 23rd 2018. The word 'coronavirus' means nothing to most of the world. I had just travelled across the sea to see Halsey live (RIP air travel). The concert is full of bops. When the show ends, the curtain closes and I am happy. [Then suddenly the stage lights up and there's a new song being teased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nByeMl2Y3VA). That, my girls and gays, is how I found out about Without Me, the song that would go #1 and somehow end up on this album, released all the way in 2020. \n\nBetween the release of Without Me and Manic, Halsey went on a detour to be a bit understandably [angry at the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_dqfcvTZik), which this sub really loved. However, that song was a commercial flop (at least as a follow up to a #1 single), so it wasn't included on this album. Halsey's reasoning was that 'it didn't fit the tone of the album', which I *get* but is also a cop-out excuse. I love Nightmare, but I have no idea what song I would remove in its place. Halsey has a thing for 16-song albums, so one would have to go. ^The ^song ^*still* ^exists, ^y'all, ^even ^if ^it ^isn't ^on ^Manic. \n\nSo what is Manic even about? It's all a bit scattered, as the album name implies. Shedding her old ideas of doing strictly 'concept albums', this album is strictly centered around Ashley Frangipane and her life experiences. In this collection of 16(++ on the deluxe edition) songs, Halsey writes candidly about her highly publicized relationship with one G-Eazy, her physical and mental health issues and how the fame she has achieved affects her life. \n\nThe albums production reflects the eclectic themes of the lyrics, ranging from electro-pop to yeehaw country bop to All Time Low-esque pop rock. Halsey shows off her industry connections with features from Alanis Morissette (!!!), Dominic Fike and Suga of BTS fame. She manages to pull all of these diverging paths together into a surprisingly cohesive album. At its core, Manic shines because of Halsey's ability to write about herself in a way that other people can relate to.\n\n\n---\n\n### Ashley\n\n&gt; *Is it really that strange*\n\n&gt; *if I always wanna change?*\n\nThe album starts of with this little self-reflective gem. Some Halsey fans believed Manic would be a retirement-record, simply because a recurring theme throughout the album is how much Halsey doesn't want to be Halsey™️ anymore. Over electro-pop instrumentals reminiscent of Badlands (and Angel on Fire from HFK), she sings about 'the old ghost town' that is her public identity. She ponders how she can get out of it, this thing she created for herself and if she's even able to. The song ends with a sample from the character Clementine, flowing into the next track.\n\n\n### clementine\n\n&gt; *My face is full of spiderwebs*\n\n&gt; *all tender, yellow, blue*\n\n&gt; *And still with one eye open*\n\n&gt; *well, all I see is you*\n\nAfter coming clean about how much she dislikes being Halsey™️, Ashley goes straight into a song that is peak Halsey. Halsey once said how much she based her personality off of Clementine, and on this song she retreats into being a stereotype of herself. She draws a picture of a Manic Pixie Dream Girl who just wants to be loved by everyone, but not close to anyone. In the chorus of the song, Halsey has a fight with herself over wanting to be wanted and wanting to be all by herself.\n\n### You Should Be Sad\n\n&gt; *I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down*\n\n&gt; *and then ran so fucking far*\n\n&gt; *that you would never ever touch me again*\n\nBet y'all never expected Halsey to do country! (And if you did, you didn't expect it to be this great.) in You Should Be Sad, Halsey does ['Before He Cheats', but more like 'After he cheats'](https://twitter.com/halsey/status/1215506076864397312). She goes down a long list of every flaw G-Eazy has, from his selfishness to his drug habit to his cheating. In the chorus she alludes to him being abusive in some way or form, which she since [confirmed](https://i.insider.com/5e38502eab49fd63f17526f9) on Instagram. \n\nCan we also just talk about how well-produced this track is? Greg Kurstin came through, as always. He also plays guitar on this track and in my opinion, the bridge-guitar is what makes this song go from a 9 to a 10!\n\n\n### Forever... (is a long time) // Dominic's Interlude // I HATE EVERYBODY\n\n&gt; *I could never hold a perfect thing and not demolish it*\n\n&gt; //\n\n&gt; *Talk to your man, tell him he got bad news coming*\n\n&gt; //\n\n&gt; *I know that it's unfair of me to make a memory out of a feeling*\n\nHalsey once stated that every album of hers has a trio of songs meant to be listened to in succession. On Manic she makes that more obvious than even with this trio of songs that bleeds into each other flawlessly. On Forever... she begins by falling in love, then getting stuck in her head. The song goes from major to minor key and her anxiety is reflected in the gorgeous piano before flowing into the next song. \n\nIn Dominic's Interlude, Dominic Fike serves as the wakeup call to Halsey by telling her like it is; *Halsey isn't in love*, she just craves attention and love. It goes directly into I HATE EVERYBODY, which is possibly Halsey's most Tumblr™️ song title. Here she gets surprisingly real and self-reflective about how she always chooses people who are bad for her. Production-wise, this song is very anthemic, with a chorus that makes you wanna sing along. \n\n### 3am\n\n&gt; *Know that my identity's always getting the best of me*\n\n&gt; *I'm the worst of my enemies*\n\n&gt; *And I don't really know what to do with me*\n\nEven without Nightmare, Manic has a little rock moment. In 3am, Halsey spends the entire song drunkenly confessing her inner secrets. She sings about how she doesn't really know what to do with herself and in turn keeps trying on different versions of herself with different people. The song ends with a voicemail from John Mayer, talking about how Without Me is such a big bop and hit. We love artists stanning other artists.  \n\n### Without Me\n\n&gt; *Tell me, how's it feel sitting  up there,*\n\n&gt; *Feeling so high but too far away to hold me*\n\nI'm not gonna go too deep into this song, but a funny thing about Without Me is that it 100% definitely about G-Eazy and his cheating habits. [However, 3 days after the song was announced, she performed Him &amp; I with him at her own damn closing show on tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbuGhrzSMMw) - the only caveat being they changed the bridge lyrics to past tense (we DID drugs together, FUCKED up clubs together etc). Make of that what you will.\n\n### More\n\n&gt; *I sit and I stare at your clothes in the drawer*\n\n&gt; *I cry and my knuckles get sore*\n\nAt the end of Manic, Halsey gets more and more personal. More is a song about her history of miscarriages due to her endometriosis. The instrumental sounds like a children's lullaby. Over the twinkling sounds, Halsey details her most intimate moments of doctors telling her there's nothing she can do. Planning for a child that doesn't arrive. The love she has for a face she hasn't met. Throughout the song's chorus she wails about how much she will love her child, whenever it decides to arrive. \n\n### 929\n\n&gt; *I wasn't in love then, and I'm still not now*\n\n&gt; *And I'm so happy I figured that out*\n\nFinishing up, we have 929 - Halsey's birthday. This is the closest Halsey has ever gotten to recreating the greatness that was [Tokyo Narita - freestyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izqwfXAWA0c). On 929, Halsey rambles over a quiet and soft beat. It almost sounds like she's sitting in a confessional. One thing I love about this song is the warmth in Halsey's vocals. If you haven't listened to any deep cuts from Manic, I implore you to listen to 929. It's the most real and honest she has ever been on a song. \n\n\n---\n\nI leave you all with some questions:\n\n&gt; 1. How does Manic compare to Halsey's previous projects?\n\n&gt; 2. How would you fit Nightmare into the Manic tracklist, if you could?\n\n&gt; 3.

The tiny little parts of pieces that make them your favorite? Maybe a transition, a measure, or a single note. A very small collection of mine:\n***\n##[Beethoven 9, IV (The Adagio ma non troppo, ma divoto)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3217H8JppI#t=3454)  \nThe first bar of this transition is just magic, and foreshadows the coming text of \"Ihr stürzt nieder [Do you bow before Him?] perfectly. It takes the suspense of the opening of \"Seid umschlungen, Millionen!\" and sets it down so gently. AND SOLI VIOLAS IN TRIPLE DIVISI? WHAAAAT?!?! You gotta be kidding me, Ludwig.\n***\n##[Robert Erickson, Corfu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlDWpDFZOJI#t=1095).  \nThe whole piece is steeped in Mediterranean sun as it is, but this little viola line sounds just like waves lapping at the Grecian shore with an ouzu martini in one hand and a gyro in the other.\n***\n##[Mahler 9, I. The very last note](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oYS2byyk1M#t=1553).  \nWe all know Mahler was a master carpenter who used the orchestra as his materials to build his sprawling cathedrals of sound. And here, we must wait nearly half an hour to hear the resolution of this motif once whispered, yawped, lilted, debated, defiled and revered. But this final note is like the last firefly going out on the longest night of your life, just before dawn.\n***\n##[Prokofiev 2nd concerto (opening)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCeo1vyewEg)  \n##[Prokofiev 2nd concerto (climax)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCeo1vyewEg#t=553)\nAnother piece full of perfect moments, but this one gets you at the start. The opening two bars, a terse, martial theme for pizz strings and a smattering of winds, is stated and goes into hiding- until the climax of the movement, that is. The soloist's titanic cadenza finally unleashes itself, and the orchestra comes *roaring* back in, blowing like the Israelites at Jericho with that theme we haven't heard since the outset of the movement. It's a superb twist of the form and shows Prokofiev's wit at it's fullest. \n***\n\nYour turn!\n", "score": 5.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/2t9i3t/perfect_moments/", "name": "t3_2t9i3t", "source_subreddit": "classicalmusic", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Beethoven", "Robert Erickson", "Mahler", "Prokofiev"], "songs": ["The Adagio ma non troppo", "ma divoto", "Corfu", "Mahler 9", "I", "Prokofiev 2nd concerto (opening)", "Prokofiev 2nd concerto (climax)"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Symphony No. 11", "last half of the last movement", "Sanctus from Britten's War Requiem", "Partita for eight voices", "Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "alpine symphony", "7th Symphony", "Sym.

I've just finished looking at [This Hype Week guide to TOs rap scene](http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/2jmkig/hype_week_guide_to_toronto/) and I have to say im pretty disapointed in it. Many of the rappers who are getting a buzz were left out for rap thats considered underground. Torontos rap scene is blossoming and is home to many a talented artist. Ill bet that in 5ish years Toronto will have one of the biggest rap scenes. Any ways ill start with the most obvious.\n\n***(Literally can't add anymore, sorry, cap reached)\n***\n\n**The OVO Crew**\n\nSince this crew is by far the most poppin ill get it out of the way first, Many of the artists in the ovo crew are GTA made so ill be focusing on them.\n\n**PARTYNEXTDOOR**: Currently is blowing up in a big way, yall probably already know about him so ill keep it brief. In short hes an RnB singer often compared to the weeknd, he uses auto tune in most of his songs.\nHeres Two essential songs by him.\n\n* [PND - Break From Toronto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXYq9ImJIN8)\n* [PND - Recognize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsPfSXJaelk)\n\n**P. Reign**: Probably the most thuggish in the OVO crew, at this point he hasn't really figured out his sound but he has alot of potential. Hes been known in Toronto for quite a while now. The songs i'm gonna recommend are his newer ones.\n\n* [P. Reign Ft PND &amp; Meek Mill - Realest in the city](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0ZrHgqsJjM) (Driving anthem currently)\n* [P. Reign - In This Cup / Cry For You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u24gVEI1VGc)\n\n**OB O'Brien**: Can be seen in many of Drake music videos, Hes comes from Hamilton, and is one of Drizzys closest friends. Hes not the greatest rapper technically but hes pretty fun. His remix of 2on with Drake got pretty big.\n\n* [OB O'brien Ft. Drake - 2on / Thotful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B--v2JZN2E)\n\n* [OB O'Brien - Steve Nash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZORHNmJDjE)\n\n**Majid Jordan**: Are an RnB duo who provided the hook for \"Hold On Were Going Home\" who have two tapes under their bealt. They are decently different from anyone else in the OVO crew, there very chill. Great music for relaxing.\n\n* [Majid Jordan - A Place Like This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klgbYfu5MCQ)\n* [Majid Jordan - Chill Pad Deluxe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?\nv=yrDhdwpweYE)\n\n**Jimmy Johnson** is an oddball, he uses a heavy autotune slur but I can't quite put my finger on what it sounds like. He's one of the if not the only rapper in OVO to have gone without a Drake feature. Johnson frequently collabs with producer Eric Dingus, which fits his sound perfectly. Youll find your self moaning along to the lines. He probably has the least amount of hype behind him in the crew.\n\n* [Jimmy Johnson - Northside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPgcSFO6qOg)\n* [Jimmy Johnson - Sun Goes Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-c2CBXHcNo)\n\n\nFinally we are done with the OVO crew that come out of the Greater Toronto Area. We can move on to other buzzing artists.\n\n**Daniel Caesar** I can almost guarantee this guy will blow up, every little bit he gets a big cosign from a blog. He's an RnB / Soul singer (Emphasis on the soul influence). If you like Frank Ocean youre probably going to like this. DO NOT SLEEP I REPEAT DO NOT SLEAP ON HIM.\n\n* [Daniel Caeser - Violet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-EHa2Mwt44)\n* [Daniel Caeser Ft. Sean Leon - We'll Always Have Paris](https://soundcloud.com/danielcaesar/well-always-have-paris)\n\n**Sean Leon** On the note of that last feature we have Sean Leon, A rapper coming out of Ajax. Hes garnering a buzz of his most recent project \"The Drowning of Ego\". I find it difficult to describe him, he's loosly similar to Travi$ Scott and Darker rap that isnt Death Rap.\n\n* [Sean Leon - Narcissus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3f9AnUxvPc)(Really long song)\n\n* [Sean - Leon - Pretty Girls Put Boys In Cemetarys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMKTPCLO2UY)\n\n**Tre Capital** Is heavily associated with the afformentioned artist Sean Leon. He has a pretty similar sound, which seems to be a popular up and coming sound in Toronto right now.\n\n* [Tre Capital Ft. Sean Leon - Prestige](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtAjf2FiCtY&amp;list=UUlYD-AGuO5coyJOa02Dhu5w)\n* [Tre Capital Ft. Deazy - 19 &amp; Thuggin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K1wWjCQSsc)\n\n**Big Lean** is definitely a harder rapper than most of the people on the list, more in his upbringing than his sound. He has kind of a drill and heavy drake influence. He got alot of attention for his song with Sosa. He has a few mixtapes under his bealt. He also sounds similar to Tory Lanez\n\n* [Big Lean Ft. Chief Keef - Life Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4jAa5Za-nQ)\n\n* [Big Lean - Everythings Alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7u7gkQnMQY)\n\n**Tory Lanez** has made a decent splash in the rap game already. Hes been used as a hook man but he actually has some bars. He could easily be dissmissed as another generic rapper, which to be fair is partially true but he has some stellar songs. He has clear Drake influence like many other TO artists.\n\n* [Tory Lanez - Apartment 310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0OC0DBulgE)\n* [Tory Lanez - The GodFather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umHmp921NnI)\n\n**Pyes** is another drake imitater with almost no buzz right now. Im gonna be honest and say I'm not a big fan at the moment but I think he has potential to hone his craft and be halfway decent.\n\n* [Pyes - Don't Touch Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRTHj5QozN4)\n* [Pyes - All Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq5jxoNa2QY)\n\n**Roney** is really bout it, theirs nothing more to say. I can say this because hes currently being charged for Human Trafficking, Forcible Confinement, Gang Sexual Assault and Juvenile Prostitution. Hes Toronto's answer to drill, simple as that. You can hear his accent as its pretty prevalent in his music. Toronto isn't a tough place but you don't wanna go around where hes from.\n\n*  [Roney - Won't Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPQxtLHXOCs)\n* [Roney - Lean Wit It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZPv5X0_IOM)\n\n**Raz Fresco** is Toronto's Joey Bada$$, hes got a love for 90'\ns rap and you can clearly hear that in his music.He comes from Brampton and is 19 years old. He's put out a slew of mixtapes, and is garnering a buzz.\n\n* [Raz Fresco - Retro Raptor 7's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YujcWKGdf50)\n* [Raz Fresco - Phony One's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzFS5KcGiYg)\n\n**Rich Kidd** is pretty known within Toronto, his debut album won a Juno, which is like a Canadian music award people preten to care about. He started as a producer and still does, but like Hit-Boy peoplpe found out hes a half decent rapper. Hes not really on the come up, hes more in the underground scene.\n\n* [Rich Kidd - SYKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obGr5Tb4P7g)\n* [Rich Kidd - Can I Get A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEKQJjErGwM)\n\nEDIT: MORE ADDED DUE TO REQUESTS\n\n**JD Era** is a Toronto rapper who's worked with Mac Miller, Raekwon, Tony Touch and has Drake affiliation. He has abit of an older style but im not talkin 90's. Don't really see him getting big as he doesnt have any really interesting about him. But he might get more respected in the Toronto rap community.\n\n* [JD Era - Hate On Me Later Ft. Mac Miller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdcKcIcRi_8)\n* [JD Era - Smoking Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66qcM6ocjVk)\n\n**D-Pryde** Wasnt sure if I should include him but since people requested him why not. He has or had a HUGE YouTube following and is probably the most successful YouTube rapper ever. He's an Asian rapper from just outside Toronto, and im telling you every hypebeast in Toronto loves him. Ive had people tell me he's the greatest rapper ever. And while I disagree with that, he's not too bad.\n\n* [D-Pryde - Trill Bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGbexQ_1bSM&amp;list=UUYHWBn5kZoJEsocsC-ofOPg)\n* [D-Pryde - My Last Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA2a7-W5DNw&amp;list=UUYHWBn5kZoJEsocsC-ofOPg)\n\n**Tre Mission** By popular request and just for his talent I'm adding him. The guy has a crazy good flow, with obvious grime influence. I swear you can almost hear the British accent in his voice. Don't know how popular he'll e in north america but he's already poppin overseas in the UK. He's gotten some big cosigns from Grime legends.\n\n* [Tre Mission - Runnup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zJVFDh6A6I)\n\n* [Tre Mission Ft. Thes - Stigmata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdqfQX7BIaU)\n\n**Random Others**\n\n* [**Tasha The Amazon** - Scallywags](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJrz_EY9cB0) Got an electronic beat, I hear a grime rap influence.\n\n* [**A-Game** - No Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaxhKHMteSg) consists of twins, imo pre mediocre but some may like them.\n* [**4th Pyramid** - Look Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDRhc52XQRI) really smooth good winter music. I think he's stopped rapping which is kind of sad because he's pretty good. Man loves his soul sample.\n* [**Dante Leon** - Northern Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jflfiomJvco)\n* [**YT!** - Hit Em](http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhF57nvQQBtlDZZeRx) Pretty generic but its pretty hype. He looks like Tyga and YG had a baby. Also I know the dude who made the beat, hes crazy talented.\n* [**The Airplane Boys** - Beau Monde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDOIG8HKUZA) These guys had a decent buzz going for them but have seemingly disappeared.\n* [**Jazz Cartier** - Switch / Downtown Cartier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH_QApWnu-A)\n* [**Keelo Ft. Sick** - So Bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwk7Oql4Rhc) In the same category as Roney, this dude can spit and his accent isnt as intense as others from Toronto. That Weeknd sample too.\n* [**Drew Howard** - Uncle Tona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIkZ5vKs3Q) This is a really chill song. haven't heard anything else by him but hes got a good vibe\n\n", "score": 259.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/2jp6eo/guide_a_better_guide_to_torontos_rap_scene/", "name": "t3_2jp6eo", "source_subreddit": "hiphopheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["The OVO Crew", "PARTYNEXTDOOR", "P.

{"query": "as a genre is a useful or harmful categorization? And finally, what are the reasons behind the commercial success of songs with religious themes, even when they are ambiguous or subtly expressed?\" Rewritten Question: Considering examples like Kanye West's *Jesus is King*, Switchfoot's *Learning to Breathe*, Emeli Sande's \"Next To Me\" (which sparked speculation about its lyrical meaning referencing either a romantic relationship or a relationship with God), Evanescence's early career and their dispute with Wind Up Records and *Christian Music Magazine* after appearing on Christian charts despite their denial of being a \"Christian rock band\" and their debut album selling 17 million copies, and Masked Wolf's explicit declaration of faith in \"G O D,\" how and why do religious themes manifest in pop, rap, and rock music, and what are the factors contributing to the commercial success of songs with religious themes, even when those themes are ambiguous or subtly expressed, and furthermore, is the categorization of \"Christian music\" as a distinct genre ultimately a useful or harmful distinction", "combined_text": "Religion and pop Religion is a pretty polarizing and complex topic in of itself, so it's not surprising that religion has a complicated relationship with music too.\n\nWhen pop or rap or rock has religious themes, they are often not simply considered those genres but [instead pigeonholed as its own subgenre of Christian music](https://www.billboard.com/charts/christian-songs/), even though sonically there isn't much common-ground between Kanye West's *Jesus is King* and Switchfoot's *Learning to Breathe.* \n\nExplicitly Christian music also often struggles on the charts, most likely because not everyone is Christian, and even among Christians a lot of them aren't interested in Christian music. \n\nOne way around this is to write about Christian themes vaguely enough that it can still appeal to a secular audience. When Scottish singer Emeli Sande released [Next To Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nwdjQmc_N8), there was [some speculation](https://www.digitalspy.com/music/single-reviews/a362316/emeli-sand-next-to-me-single-review/) about whether the lyrics referred to her relationship with a man or her relationship with God. Regardless, the song shot to #2 on the UK charts. If it was written about God, then it was probably a wise move to keep it ambiguous and thus more accessible. \n\nAnother example is allegedly Evanescence, though they have denied this. In the early days of their career, their music appeared on the Christian charts. The band were pretty confused by this, [stating \"we're Christians in a rock band, not a Christian rock band\".](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/fallen-from-grace-1.1149464) Their then-label Wind Up Records took offence at this, and Christian Music Magazine stopped promoting them. Whether they genuinely were just a secular rock band that happened to have Christian members, or if there were underlying Christian themes the band were coy about, Evanescence were a huge success and their debut album has sold 17 million copies to-date. \n\nOther examples are more cut and dry, like Masked Wolf abruptly stating [\"I believe in G O D, don't believe in T H O T\".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEg-oqI9qmw) While the lyric was widely memed, it didn't stop the song reaching #6 on the US charts.\n\nWith all this in mind, what are some interesting examples of religious themes in pop? Do you think Christian music should be considered its own genre?

(Though, if I remember correctly, if you've watched Space Dandy this name may be familiar.) If you're into Kitty Pryde or that type of female aesthetic in hip-hop, this may be for you. I'm not trying to say Japanese &gt; American or anything, but I personally feel that the japanese language lends itself to the 'cutesy' style a bit more easily. Again, if you're into that. If there is at least one thing to take away from 'My Room My Stage', it would probably be in the instrumentals. Varied, yet simple and relaxing, I haven't heard anything like this in awhile, or at least anyone rapping over these types of beats. The vocals are light and fluffy, as expected due to the music, but I can't say much on them since I can't understand it mostly. But it works for me.\n\nMy personal favorites are Candle, 棄てるなどして, ドレスを着る前に and 東京近郊路線図. (Can be found in the description of the album stream.)\n\nJust something a little different for the sake of diversity. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND IF THIS ISN'T YOUR THING, but I fuck with this heavy.

I have also recently enjoyed Chloe x Halle's covers of [Sending My Love](https://youtu.be/lJEyUlM1bY8) and [Georgia On My Mind](https://youtu.be/64RyzY08ixk). The production and vocals on both of these are top-notch.", "score": 82.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/omh7r8/best_recent_artist_covers/", "name": "t3_omh7r8",

The verses are fun and very creative IMO and I absolutely LOVE the chorus, it's genuinely one of my favourite choruses ever. It gives 90's, it's dreamy, it kind of reminds me of The Cranberries, it's perfection. The post chorus is also charming.\n\nAnd then there's the bridge (??? Idk, it's where the bridge normally goes) which is a... rap by Einar, which reminds you that there were other people besides Björk in that band ig. It's *terrible*. It just sucks so much omfg, the words barely make sense, the delivery is cringe and annoying, it goes in forever and it's just completely unnecessary. The contrast between the godly chorus and this thing hits you like truck. There's a [rapless edit on YouTube ](https://youtu.be/v-rKl2KuAoM) that clears my skin and pays my bills and I listen to it exclusively \n\nBut anyway, what are some songs that have made you memorize the exact point in the progress bar you have to skip to?

She was my best friend and the same age as me. She lost her battle with cancer. She had beaten once, two years earlier, but it came back. Link: http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vnLWc-0FZYg\n\n●Devin Townsend- Funeral. This song is just heavy to me for some reason. It's beautiful yet haunting. I don't really know why. It just is.

We weren't super close but I knew him better than the other kids in the school who were saying they were \"best friends\" and \"so close\" to him.

Amsterdam is a must listen for anyone who hasn’t checked the album outside the hit singles, it’s one of their most powerful songs in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I think the album has essentially no skips and is one of their best, and the start of an amazing run from here to Viva la Vida.", "score": 104.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/wy03og/a_rush_of_blood_to_the_head_was_released_20_years/", "name": "t3_wy03og", "source_subreddit": "popheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Coldplay"], "albums": ["A Rush of Blood to the Head"], "songs": ["Clocks", "The Scientist", "Politik", "In My Place", "Amsterdam"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Politik", "Clocks", "Clocks", "Politik", "title track", "Clocks", "Daylight", "Green Eyes", "Amsterdam", "In My Place", "In My Place", "Clocks", "Warning Sign", "Daylight", "Warning Sign", "self titled track", "Politik", "Clocks", "Green Eyes", "Amsterdam", "in my place", "Stairway to Heaven", "Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_ilu496j", "score": 51.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Politik", "Coldplay"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Politik", "Clocks"]}}, {"name": "t1_ilu2k4l", "score": 25.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Clocks"]}}, {"name": "t1_iluw2ve", "score": 16.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Politik", "title track"]}}, {"name": "t1_ilvvzjo", "score": 4.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Coldplay"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Clocks", "Daylight", "Green Eyes", "Amsterdam", "In My Place"]}}, {"name": "t1_ilu5m5u", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": ["In My Place", "Clocks", "Warning Sign", "Daylight"], "songs": ["In My Place", "Clocks", "Warning Sign", "Daylight"]}}, {"name": "t1_ilwbm3y", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Coldplay"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Warning Sign"]}}, {"name": "t1_ilvelwb", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": ["self titled album"], "songs": ["self titled track"]}}, {"name": "t1_ilxqcfe", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Coldplay"], "albums": ["Ghost Stories"], "songs": ["Politik", "Clocks", "Green Eyes", "Amsterdam"]}}, {"name": "t1_ily7c8o", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": ["in my place"], "songs": ["in my place"]}}, {"name": "t1_ilzl5sp", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_ilu6xke", "score": 0.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}], "bucket": "other"}

We recommend each other a lot of pieces we love, but I think it'd be interesting to share unpopular opinions on popular pieces within classical circles. I'm talking about pieces that one would likely only know particularly if they're into classical music and that are appraised *mainly within* the classical community - including this sub - not necessarily extremely famous pieces like Debussy's Clair de lune or Beethoven's Für Elise (I'm not saying these are necessarily overrated.)\n\nFor me, one piece a lot of people gush about that I think is overhyped is Dvorak's String Quartet No. 12, \"American,\" oh boy. I get the appeal with its charming first theme and the \"country\" character of the piece, but IMO this composition offers little musical substance other than sounding fun. It just doesn't explore enough depth in ideas to really sell its concept and is filled with empty rhetoric and beats certain textures and ideas to death. The first movement - and all the other movements individually, for this matter - lacks contrast to free it from monotonous jolliness and anticipation. It was sketched in 3 days and completed in 13, and it really shows; I'm not at all using this as an opportunity to put down Dvorak or his composition, but it indeed sounds like it was written quickly and without much sincerity. Bash me if you want for being harsh, but it's just my opinion.\n\nI'd like to suggest the criminally underrated [Debussy's String Quartet in G minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8I7uHb7GY0), which brings me to the verge of tears.

So I was recently pondering over minor and major keys and it didn't take me long to arrive at the conclusion that it's apparently not entirely easy to write genuinely happy music in a minor key. It seems to lend itself well to expressing other emotions: melancholy, sadness, heroics, doubt etc. Major keys on the other hand can cover those, too.\n\nI've barely been able to come up with even a short list of minor key pieces that express happiness or exuberance. And even those are somewhat questionable. It's pieces that may at a formal level be in a minor key but then immediately modulate to a major key and remain there for most of the time, such as the [Rondo](http://youtu.be/0IT7f8AUlMg?t=56m57s) of Mahler's 7th Symphony.

If I make some slight allowances I would let this pass as upbeat. Similarly the [last movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTJanAJb06Q) of Brahms's Piano Quartet in g-minor (needless to say, it's another *alla zingarese*).\n\nNot explicitly tagged Hungarian is the [finale](http://youtu.be/Br1MKrBs_o8) of Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony. Its happiness however seems to be more due to the fact that it's really a benevolent parody of the Italian music at the time.\n\nWhat all of these in any case seem to have in common is that their happiness (more wittiness really) seems to be coming from energetic tempi and rhythms. I draw a total blank when I am looking for music that conveys a sense of happiness through melody and/or harmony in the sense that, say, the opening theme of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony does it.\n\nSo if you would, can I have your list of recognizably happy music written predominantly in a minor key?

Some commentators have been moved to judge it the best of Atterberg's symphonies, and I would not dissent from that. The composer called it Västkustbilder ('West Coast Pictures') and I have also seen it referred to by the English title 'Ocean Pictures' and the German 'Meeressymphonie', all of which seem adequate as descriptions of the symphony's programmatic material. The arrangement of the three movements - two slow movements divided by a quick one - is remarkably effective. The movements are 'Soldis' (translated in the booklet as 'Sun smoke' - 'Sun haze' gives a better idea), 'Storm' and 'Sommernatt'. The exciting storm music in the vivid middle movement is strongly reminiscent of the climax of Arnold Bax's orchestral tone-poem November Woods, which, when I asked Atterberg about it in the early 1970s, he assured me he had never heard.\n\n**Ways to Listen**\n\n* [YouTube - Sixten Ehrling with the Malmo Symphony Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iUIiVVGUHs), includes score\n\n* [Spotify - Ari Rasilainen and the Hannover Radio Philharmonic Orchestra](https://open.spotify.com/album/0xeovbKyNJTZWKG1YQn1rJ?si=IGXv2PlwQVqz_il5eZt4Lg)\n\n* [Spotify - Neeme Järvi and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra](https://open.spotify.com/album/23nOLiB5Hl3ZoyFITAOOQq?si=YLfy4xKORLCufxjC96D_JA_\n\n**Discussion Prompts**\n\n* What are your favorite parts or moments in this work?

Their cover of [Mansion on the Hill] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI4uX4ltX80) adds a whole different vibe to the song, and i think them taking on some of Bruce's rockier numbers could produce some fantastic results.\n\nSongs that they'd cover:\n\n[Adam Raised A Cain] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0xoClNtXi0)\n\n[All That Heaven Will Allow] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdJIpyiupJo)\n\n[Candy's Room] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx1N3Kjx1OU)\n\n[The River] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAB4vOkL6cE)\n\n[Spirit in the Night] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3quyLpUuhk)\n\n[Brilliant Disguise] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idnJnjV_8rg)\n\n[My Best Was Never Good Enough] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjbt1CbouoM)\n\nThe slower tracks I think would take much the same route as Mansion On The Hill, but with The National's cynicism and more depressing nature showing through.
