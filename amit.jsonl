Her recent [Expo 2020](https://youtu.be/UwheI-dGoeE) performance in Dubai reassured me of that forreal! \n\nI do feel music fans tend to toss her aside as a possibility because they think it'll just be \"Piano and I\" vibes, but like who cares? Alicia Key is an R&amp;B superstar!

Though I am one of the few who would love an intimate, halftime show of Rhythm and blues bangers like \"Fire We Make\" and \"Unthinkable\". I really am more of an RnbHead than a Pophead tbh lol. \n\nI am aware that yes, Alicia isn't as huge as she once was, so she would probably need another headliner to balance things out, which leads me to............

I would've selected Kendrick since they do have the Spiderman collab, but he's already a headliner for this years.\n\nAnyways, it's getting late, so I'll wrap it up HERE, haha get it?

I'm asking for advice from you guys because there is a somewhat specific kind of music that I love, absolutely love, and I would like to find more of it but I don't know if it has a proper name.\n\nI love listening to classical compositions which rely mostly on accords and arpeggios, and convey more of a sense of harmony rather than a definite melody (although there can be some melody to it, and the piece can even be very melodic).\n\nLet me give you some examples to better illustrate what I'm looking for:\n\n- Albinoni's [oboe concerto in D minor, 2nd mvt - adagio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5nnGwcuTA)\n\n- The well known first prelude for piano by JS Bach (you know [the one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TncQYnTjqlA)) or, in the same vein but more subtle of course, his well-known prelude for Cello (the one Rostropovitch famously played before the Berlin wall back then)\n\n- The best example and the one I like the most would be [Haendel's 'Zadok the Priest' coronation anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiXgOQ9_-RI), BEFORE the choirs start screaming bloody murder (ZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADOK THE P- oh gimme a break I just want to enjoy the arpeggios).\n\n\nThere is something about voiceless, calm, elaborate arpeggions that makes them so very soothing to me. It starts in harmony and gradually explores all the breadth and depth of the harmonic possibilities until it almost sounds dissonant, unbalanced, but then it quickly goes back to perfection and the world is just so full of light and happiness. Be it in major or minor.\n\nIt's come to the point where I write some myself and play them on the piano or clarinet for my own pleasure. But I can't do that on public transportation (where the soothing properties of music are most needed) and I'm not so good a player nor a composer of course.\n\nDo you know any piece of music that you would recommend to me in this regard?\n\nMany thanks and may you live a nice arpeggio filled life :)", "score": 6.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/4lp4o9/can_you_recommend_some_arpeggioheavy_lyricless/", "name": "t3_4lp4o9", "source_subreddit": "classicalmusic", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Albinoni", "JS Bach", "Handel"], "songs": ["Adagio from Albinoni's Oboe Concerto in D minor", "First Prelude for Piano by JS Bach", "Prelude for Cello by JS Bach", "Zadok the Priest Coronation Anthem by Handel"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Alia Fantasia", "Toccata Arpeggiata", "Plan and Elevation"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_hvqa8ei", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Nicola Matteis", "G.G. kapsberger", "Gavin Bryars", "Caroline Shaw"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Alia Fantasia", "Toccata Arpeggiata", "Plan and Elevation"]}}], "bucket": "music"}

Interested in original material.  Actually, Diana Krall's \"The Girl in the Other Room' is a good example as well, with some of the original tracks she included in that  album.\n\nActually, open to male vocalists too.

{"query": "Considering a \"cultural reset\" in pop music is defined as an influential moment that sets a trend, raises the bar, or changes expectations, **what pop music moments, such as the Pussycat Dolls' X Factor comeback performance (which felt like a 10.1 magnitude event with potential to revive girl groups and dominate charts), Zendaya's *Replay* and debut album, or Tinashe's career and song \"No Drama,\" were initially perceived as potential cultural resets but ultimately failed to significantly impact the music industry, and what factors contributed to their lack of lasting influence?**", "combined_text": "What's a pop music moment you thought was a \"cultural reset\", but it didn't reset anything? * I'll go first, I swore up and down and thought the [Pussycat Dolls comeback performance](https://youtu.be/dY09peNVVLc) at the X Factor was a moment that shook the earth at a 10.1 magnitude. Like I felt it in my bones this was like pop music history with that performance. They were gonna run the charts like it was '05 again, make girl groups a thing again, sell out tours, serve us looks and give bomb performances. But then nothing happened, and Nicole messily announced their tour cancellation publicly before letting the members of PCD know...\n* Honorable mentions: Zendaya's Replay + debut album I thought Disney had another huge popstar in the making, Tinashe's whole career...I thought her song No Drama was her 2 On 2.0 and she could have a re-do. \n\nMy understanding of a \"cultural reset\" in music industry: It's an influential moment in music industry that set a trend for other artists to hop on, or it \"raised the bar\" in xyz category or changed our expectations for pop music. \n\nEx. of cultural resets: Katy Perry's Teenage Dream singles run, Britney Spears' debut era, Bey's self-titled changing tracking week to start on Friday, Justin Bieber being the first major popstar from the Internet.\n\n**Hard mode:** Songs/artists that has some level of mainstream presence or they charted somewhere on Earth (even on bubbling). \n\nMy other question is, what went wrong after the huge moment?", "score": 234.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/t76koc/whats_a_pop_music_moment_you_thought_was_a/", "name": "t3_t76koc", "source_subreddit": "popheads",

Specifically, the remastered version here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LH5YRqZUaY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LH5YRqZUaY)\n\nI know Faith Hill was nominated for a Grammy for the song, but for some reason it never reached #1, in the U.S. at least. Why was this the case? Was the song sunk by the negative reviews the movie got? Are her other songs (such as \"This Kiss\") just better? Did people just not think much of it because they thought it was just another in the line of big Diane Warren power ballads from a Jerry Bruckheimer movie?\n\nAlso, what do you think of the song itself? Is it one of Faith Hill's better songs? Is it just \"meh\"?\n\nOpinions and explanations, please!\n\nTYVM!!\n\nEdit: A couple of you have mentioned that it wasn't physically released as a single.

I went on a bit of a Wikipedia hip hop binge last night and came across a rapper/producer named Tony D that died a couple years ago. He was apparently a pretty big deal in the late 80s New Jersey hip hop scene, and claimed for years that Naughty by Nature jacked the \"O.P.P.\" beat from him. The group pretty much disparaged the dude in rare interviews where they were asked about it, but Tony pretty much stuck with his story to the grave. That they heard his instrumental album from 1988, and jacked it for use on O.P.P.\n\nIt took me a long time to dig it up but I found it. The song is called \"Adam's Nightmare\" and can be heard here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo5\\_K6EGtPQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo5_K6EGtPQ)\n\nThe beat starts at 24:44.\n\nNow I'd be the first to admit there's a lot of artists who use the same samples as others (remember the Onyx and AZ controversy with the \"Welcome Back Kotter\" sample?) but I gotta say, this is pretty damning. It's...the same exact beat, with the same exact samples used in the same exact unique ways (especially the lyrical vocal samples).\n\nThe fact that Tony D was from the same area as NbN and his instrumental album came out a good 3 years before OPP, and it makes it incredibly likely to me that they heard this beat and straight up jacked the dude's production for their own.\n\nJust wondering what everyone else thinks. I think Naughty are an extremely talented group and I'm not trying to shit on their legacy, but I do feel bad that this dude essentially got fucked out of any recognition for what a great beatmaker he was. I also didn't like the way Vin and KayGee came off in an interview when asked about it. They were genuinely assholes about it, while Tony D was always really diplomatic about the whole thing.\n\nThoughts after hearing the beat I linked?", "score": 1711.0, "url":

Something similar to demos from [this page](http://www.manytone.com/productinfo_upright.php) or the beginning of the Ray Brown's [Real Blues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfUhkxCWOvU). Low/mid tempo, no crazy technique demonstrations, just simple but groovy bass lines.

I just like the upright bass sound. So what I am looking for is more sustained notes, some slides perhaps, more groove and less fussy messy so called solos.

(Dvorak Symphony 9) I've been playing piano for a few years now and started to learn the cello a few weeks ago. I'm in a composing class but until very recently (a week or so) I never actually got into classical music. \n\nIt's because of my composing class that I picked up an interest in classical music to study some of the classical composers. Until then I was mainly focussing on the modern film composers like John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Steven Jablonsky and so. \n\nIn the past I played a piece on the piano from Dvorak Symphony 9, second movement and I really loved it but somehow I never looked up the entire symphony or even the original movement...   \nWhen I saw on a YT video how the Jaws theme and the beginning from the 4th movement from the symphony was so alike, I though it would be a good idea to watch the entire thing and boy was I amazed! \n\nThe second and firth movement is so amazing. The other ones as well of course but these two stand out. The 4th is my favorite and has nothing to do with the Jaws theme... It's the epicness of the brass section in the beginning and the percussion that really moves me. \n\nA new world has opened up for me, fitting with the title of the symphony :)   \nCan't wait to find more of these symphonies! \n\nHere's the version I just watched and loved it to bits!

But oh well. The album starts of with the incredible 'That's My Girl' both an album and a career highlight. A few songs later we find probably my favourite album cut 'I Lied' which is just an anthem for me and other people for whom one of their favourite things to do, one of their talents one of their hobbies is lying. 'All In My Head (Flex)' is a banger of a single and another album highlight.\n\nAnd then there's Work From Home, a song that sounds like a hit from the start until the end. It's hard to describe why the song works but it really does. It's just so catchy and it's the one song on the album where every note and every line sounds effortless. Plus during the beginnings of quarantine, it was an anthem for all people who suddenly had to work from home. The song has received both 1 billion streams on spotify and 1 billion views on youtube.\n\nAll in all, the album's legacy is as confusing as the group's legacy itself. It is pretty widely agreed on to be the groups best and yet it still suffers from pop album syndrome, where the singles obviously have the most effort put into them. The album rode a wave of pop that has all but faded away in the five years since it. But for what it is, a pop album where the non-singles are clearly not singles, it is pretty fun.

Sky2fall - https://youtu.be/CiATVknOfl4\nSky2fall is off of their mini mix , vol 2 ep released in 2020. It has a very airy dreamy sound. Makes me feel like when I am having so much fun, I don’t want the night to end :/ \n\n2. Ghost - https://youtu.be/DwGPE7e68E4\nGhost is a track that I believe does not belong to an ep or an album. It’s a one off track that was released in 2018. This track is what introduced me to the duo. It’s has a badass base sound that makes me wanna strut or dance when I hear it. I’m too cool vibes and with the shades on lol\n\n3. Venice - https://youtu.be/UX6Yr83sK_Q\nVenice was released in 2020 off of their album A Little Rhythm and a Wicked Feeling. This song is a cute bop that makes you want to play it while cruising highway 1 with the top down. \n\nI hope this post reaches new fans and creates a discussion to those who already appreciate their library of work.

{"query": "Considering examples like Gotye's *Somebody That I Used to Know*, Annie Lennox's *Walking on Broken Glass* (set in the Regency era), and Alanis Morissette's *Ironic* (benefiting from a recent 4K remaster), what specific stylistic or thematic elements allow certain music videos, despite subtle era-identifying clues like makeup or camerawork, to appear remarkably fresh and potentially \"timeless\" across decades, and can you provide further examples of music videos that you believe have successfully transcended the visual limitations of their original release year", "combined_text": "Which music videos haven't dated, and why? I stumbled across [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/s9fw7p/music_videos_which_just_scream_the_year_they_were/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) earlier, and my first thought was that very few music videos are timeless. Most reflect their era, whether that's [Kate Bush battling clones through the power of dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp43OdtAAkM), [Billie Piper being a CGI pioneer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_XI_290cfw), or [Madonna experimenting with Windows Movie Maker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zqZnarJQ-E).\n\nNevertheless, some videos do seem to escape the march of time. The most obvious cause is that some videos don't include things which would obviously tie them to the era in which they were made. Gotye's [*Somebody That I Used to Know*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UVNT4wvIGY), for example, has an unusual style which doesn't inherently pin it to 2011, while Annie Lennox's [*Walking on Broken Glass*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y25stK5ymlA) is set in the Regency era and therefore isn't full of early 90s fashions.\n\nSometimes an otherwise conventional video seems to defy becoming dated accidentally. In Alanis Morissette's [*Ironic* video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jne9t8sHpUc), for example, she happens to wear fairly generic clothes and doesn't use any props which would later tie the video to 1997. The fact the video has recently been remastered to 4K also helps, as the visuals no longer have the look we expect of a 90s recording.\n\nIn all three of these cases I do acknowledge that there are clues to their era — details of makeup, specifics of camerawork, and of course the songs themselves — but I do think they look remarkably fresh considering their respective ages.\n\nWhat do you think?

Hi. I'm a trombone player and I haven't much experience with jazz but I'm trying to improve. I've listened to the greats (e.g J.J) but I'm curious about the trombone's place in modern jazz. I think it's pretty obvious that we can't compete with the agility of a sax or trumpet, but I don't think trombones should be trying to anyways. What ways can the trombone be used optimally? The slide is pretty unique, how can that be used besides quick glissendos or scoops/falls? The range is in the middle, which can make things difficult from a lead perspective, but I imagine that gives options to play in a bass range or tenor/alto range? Just wanna hear your thoughts.\n\n\nAlso, any recommendations for music featuring trombone? Particularly for jazzhop or acidjazz?

Or maybe they just say the phrase \"it's a new day\" a lot ha ha.\n\nI have mixed feelings when it's sampled like it was for that FloRida song or that Avicii song. It's not that they're bad (not at all), it's just, why mess with perfection? It's just better when experienced it all its glory as it is\n\n[I Put a Spell on You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua2k52n_Bvw) shall forever be bewitching, and I like the 2017 [Duffy cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3j8qTaZs64), too. I can't believe they don't use either version more in noir films.\n\nNina's [Here Comes the Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9gMsdNQSUM) (a cover of the George Harrison classic) is the superior version [among](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BQ2_z8WR4Q)/[many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnwxiye45Jc) nice ones. \n\n[Santa Esmeralda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k2z_4vQUu8) has the top version of Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood, though. Sorry! Remember [Kill Bill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdyEhWuNtNE&amp;feature=emb_title)?\n\nTell us about your experiences with Nina's music in and of intelf and in media, and how you'd use them in movies/art yourself!\n\nRIP Nina", "score": 380.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/lp61yu/its_nina_simones_birthday_lets_talk_about_her/", "name": "t3_lp61yu", "source_subreddit": "popheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Nina Simone", "Led Zeppelin", "Pink Floyd", "Imagine Dragons", "FloRida", "Avicii", "Duffy"], "albums": ["Dark Side of the Moon", "Niagara"], "songs": ["It's a New Dawn", "I Put a Spell on You", "Here Comes the Sun", "Santa Esmeralda", "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Mississippi Goddam", "Do I Move You?", "He Ain’t Coming Home", "No More Work Song", "Little Liza Jane", "Just Like A Woman (Live 1987)", "Goddamn", "Stars", "Four Women", "Sinnerman", "I Shall Be Released", "I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free", "I Wish I Knew How it WOuld Feel to be Free", "Four Women", "Wild is the Wind", "Black is the Color of My True Love's Hair", "My baby just cares for me", "Sinnerman", "The Story of OJ", "Sample song", "Sinnerman", "To Love Somebody", "Feeling Good", "How I Feel", "Backlash Blues", "You’ve Got to Learn", "Feeling Good", "Do What You Gotta Do", "Why?

It's just such incredibly deep musical poetry, all done a couple of passages. It just blows my mind how such a small measure can have so much impact.\n\nBeethoven, Sonata No. 5 in F Major, Op. 24 \"The Spring\": II. Adagio molto espressivo:\nhttps://youtu.be/2nHREq_7VXI?t=146\n\nI remember one day I was working at a job I didn't like, and this passage played, and it melted me. The way that the minor gives way to the major key, and it's like the light is piercing through the darkness.\n\nSchubert, Four Impromptus, Op 90 No. 3:\nhttps://youtu.be/B4MUUVK8P2U?t=23\n\nI play this one, and I find myself playing this passage quite a bit even a decade after learning it.

Twelvy was there as well. Sadly his set wasn't that long either. He ended with Wild For The Night and Peso.\n- Afrika Bambaataa had a DJ set on another stage and brought out this female rapper named Sa-Roc who I didn't know, but she was pretty good. You can check a song by her [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq65f67_2bs).\n- The Weeknd performed and all the girls were so excited when he came out, It was probably the second most popular performances of the day. I don't really like the Weeknd that much, but he killed it.\n- Lastly, the Roots came out with Erykah Badu. Honestly this was one of the best performances I've ever seen. The set was probably like 1.5 hours but there was never a dull moment. They performed [You Got Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJCHeEQV454) and [Proceed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5TUqdxqHS0), among others. Erykah Badu perfomed a bunch of her songs including [Window Seat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hVp47f5YZg). During the set there were suprise performances by YG and The Lox (Jadakiss wasn't there tho). Questlove had a dope drum solo at one point. Badu proved that she hasn't lost anything, vocals-wise. \n- The only rap perfomance I didn't see was Raury.

{"query": "What melodic post-rock albums, similar in quality to Sigur Ros's *Kviekur* (particularly \"Hrafntinna\"), Alcest's *Shelter* (\"Delivrance\"), and 65Daysofstatic's *No Man's Sky* (\"Supermoon\"), feature vocals, avoid the common tropes of repetitive arpeggiated guitar lines and predictable chord progressions, incorporate strings or other instrumentation to create a fleshed-out production, and evoke feelings of hopefulness, grandeur, and catchiness, while maintaining a balance where vocals and guitars don't overshadow other instruments", "combined_text": "Looking for more melodic post-rock style albums with vocals(Examples and links inside!) I can't stand most post-rock that I come across because it all sounds the same: a clean telecaster with lots of delay doing arpeggios as more instruments play chords on the whole notes until the metal guitar with distorted legato picking comes in alongside the drums for two minutes repeating the same chord progression over and over until the song fades out. Just kill me.\n\nThere are only three albums I can point to that I feel exhibit the exact quality I'm looking for:\n\n\nSigur Ros - Kviekur. Favorite track: [Hrafntinna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaSt4Pb-2X8)\n\nA lot of their stuff is on the softer side, like Valtari, or more poppy, like Med Sud. Kveikur is a lot harder, but still retains that post-rock allure and is VERY catchy. The use of strings in the background really fleshes out the production. That album sent me on a journey into the post-rock landscape trying to find something similar, but I never quite could. \n\nAlcest - Shelter. Favorite track: [Delivrance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qCc7Hh0A5A)\n\nThe major keys used in this album really mirror the hopefulness on the album cover. The entire album is pure joy, and the production and mix is superb- never letting the guitar outshine the other instruments and melting the vocals into the songs. Even when distorted guitar is the main instrument, the songs still manage to sound bright and grandiose.\n\n65Daysofstatic - No Man's Sky. Favorite track: [Supermoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbATfutOISI)\n\nThis one doesn't have vocals, but the hummable melody is still strong and present at the front of the song, and it still the same vibes as the others. The bass and piano work together so well, and the drums are tight and boss. Love this album, and this track.\n\nCheers guys- I would love to hear some suggestions.", "score": 15.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/postrock/comments/njiids/looking_for_more_melodic_postrock_style_albums/", "name": "t3_njiids", "source_subreddit": "postrock", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Sigur Ros", "Alcest", "65Daysofstatic"], "albums": ["Kviekur", "Valtari", "Med Sud", "Shelter", "No Man's Sky"], "songs": ["Hrafntinna", "Delivrance", "Supermoon"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["In Silence We Yearn", "W.A.N.D.Y.", "Shelter", "We were always loyal to lost causes", "Stream of Consciousness", "Hiroshima", "moving mountains"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_gz7o671", "score": 5.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Hiroshima"], "albums": [], "songs": ["In Silence We Yearn"]}}, {"name": "t1_gz7opoo", "score": 4.0, "entities": {"artists": ["loro's"], "albums": [], "songs": ["W.A.N.D.Y."]}}, {"name": "t1_gz8w8ll", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Wings of the ISANG", "Sigur Ros", "Floating In Space", "Lights and Motion / Christoffer Franzen"], "albums": ["Stream of Consciousness", "A New Dawn"], "songs": ["Shelter"]}}, {"name": "t1_gza4mlg", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["The Dandelion War"], "albums": [], "songs": ["We were always loyal to lost causes"]}}, {"name": "t1_gzc7zio", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stream of Consciousness"]}}, {"name": "t1_gz8tq22", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Hiroshima", "moving mountains"]}}], "bucket": "other"}

The lead up to this in the Mingus track also has some of the same tension in the harmony that Schoenberg uses in the piece leading up to it.

{"query": "Considering Nikolai Medtner's music, often overshadowed by composers like Rachmaninoff and Scriabin, and characterized by charming melodies, unique Romantic color, and considerable technical difficulty for performers despite seemingly accessible scores, why isn't he as widely popular as Rachmaninoff, and where would someone begin exploring his works, specifically considering his *Fairy Tales* (Op. 20-1), Piano Concerto No. 2, Violin Sonata No. 3, *Sonata Romantica*, and *Sonata-Ballade* as recommended starting points", "combined_text": "A composer to explore: Nikolai Medtner Nikolai Medtner. One of the last Romantic composer whose music often gets set aside by Rachmaninoff, Scriabin, and then other modernist composers. However, his music is full of awesome moments and surprises, which makes me wonder why isn't he as popular as Rachmaninoff. \n\nHe is one of my favorite composers, and for a reason: many of his pieces are full of charming melodies. Just listen to his Piano Concerto No.2, Violin Sonata No.3, Sonata Romantica, Fairy tale Op.20-1, and more... In his music, you will find a unique branch of Romanticism that might sound similar to Rachmaninoff at first, but as you go deeper, you will see the unique color of Medtner. \n\nThe only thing about Medtner is some of his music is immensely hard. It does not seem hard when you look at the score, but when you try to execute it, it is so hard to get the melody in place and express the emotions, which might be one of the reason that not many pianists play Medtner. \n\n**Anyway, a good place to start is his Сказки, or \"Fairy Tales\"**. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnrWG\\_i7peY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnrWG_i7peY)) They are short, and very straightforward. Also, they are less hard to play, compared to his sonatas. They are full of lyrical, lush moments, nice counterpoints, and rhythmic inventions. \n\nAnother good place to start is his **second piano concerto (**[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6Bai6h3Gds**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6Bai6h3Gds)**)**. Out of the three piano concertos, this one is my favorite. It is full of dramatic moments, as well as soft and lyrical sections. \n\nAmong the sonatas (which he composed 14), I suggest looking into **Sonata Romantica** ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U\\_EAmPjn08Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_EAmPjn08Y)) and **Sonata-Ballade** ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E3reaOoLA0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E3reaOoLA0)) first.

{"query": "* each other. Given the popularity of \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" from *Encanto*, which prominently features overlapping vocal melodies (counterpoint), what are some other examples of counterpoint being utilized effectively in pop music, and considering pop music's tendency towards straightforward structures and solo vocals, why is this technique seemingly less common in the genre compared to musical theatre?\"", "combined_text": "Given the success of \"We Don't Talk About Bruno,\" what are some examples of counterpoint in pop music? So \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" has blown up and if you've never listened to it before, [check it out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvWRMAU6V-c) and pay special attention to what happens in the back half of the song. It should be obvious but in case you don't get what I'm talking about I'll spell it out: the characters all start singing over each other and it sounds really cool. This specific style of overlapping singing is called \"counterpoint\" and I wanna talk about it.\n\n* **Counterpoint** is when multiple, complementary melodies are performed over the same chords– or to get more abstract, it's when two parts of a song are written to be played to the same music and fit together like puzzle pieces.\n\nThis sounds kinda complicated when written out like that but it's really easy to pick it up when you hear it. A classic, very easy to understand example of counterpoint is [\"You're Just In Love\" by Irving Berlin](https://youtu.be/2LAijDQ2cIE?): one melody is sung first, then the second, then we hear them on top of each other and realize they were meant to go together all along.\n\nIf the songwriter is smart enough this can be done with [three parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAIlVCStp3c), [four parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-oyVRuPRlY), [five parts](https://youtu.be/Z8WiudDlTBw?t=493), or more! It's *such* a great musical device because it's so satisfying to hear the pieces connect and it's always a feast for the ears to hear overlapping melodies.\n\nYou'll notice all the examples I have been linking are from musicals though, and it's because I feel like it's a lot less common in pop music. If I had to guess it's because pop music tends to be more straightforwards so a somewhat complex melodic trick like counterpoint doesn't fit. Most commercial music is for solo voices as well, additional vocals are generally relegated to the background; when there are featured artists there's a big focus on their personalities so they don't generally end up singing *over* each other (they just kinda take turns or work in harmony).\n\nWhat are songs in non-musical theatre genres that aren't afraid to embrace counterpoint?", "score":

I was actually blown away by how genius it really is - every single note is so well-placed and every note is integral to the architecture of the piece. I actually felt like I understood everything about it from beginning to end, and nothing seemed out of place or the slightest bit arbitrary or \"faked.\" The andante section, while it sounds more melodic or \"more tonal\" in nature, sounded perfect in the flow of the entire piece. While it's not exactly something most people would listen to for pure enjoyment, much like a symphony or something, it's an extremely intellectual piece of music in probably the purest form (\"pure interval music,\" in the words of Stravinsky) you can possibly have, the fugue. Glenn Gould said it was perhaps the greatest piece ever composed, which to some degree I would agree. I would actually argue that some of Bach gets more harmonically complex, though as Stravinsky has said, it is an \"absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever.\"\n\nI'd also like to add that the first movement of Op. 131 is quite genius as well and its musical content is amazing for serving as a broad description of how Op. 133, a more complex fugue, works as a contrapuntal composition.", "score": 33.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/saq2qx/i_just_heard_beethovens_grosse_fuge_op_133_its/", "name": "t3_saq2qx", "source_subreddit": "classicalmusic", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Beethoven", "Bach", "Glenn Gould", "Stravinsky"], "songs": ["Grosse Fuge", "Op. 133", "Andante"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Emerson Quartet's version", "Beethoven's own arrangement for piano four hands", "Op. 134", "Fugue", "Cavatina", "fugue"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_htvqlda", "score": 6.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Emerson Quartet", "Beethoven", "Duo d'Accord"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Emerson Quartet's version", "Beethoven's own arrangement for piano four hands", "Op. 134"]}}, {"name": "t1_htx0leo", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Beethoven", "Takács Quartet", "Quatuor Ébène"], "albums": ["String Quartet No. 13", "Op. 130"], "songs": ["Fugue", "Cavatina"]}}, {"name": "t1_htzesz4", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["fugue"]}}], "bucket": "other"}

{"query": "thing work.\" Rewrite the post as a question. \"Considering the historical precedent of live instrumentation in early hip hop tracks like \"Rapper's Delight\" by The Sugarhill Gang and \"The Breaks\" by Kurtis Blow, and given recent examples like DJ Dahi's reproduction of The Isley Brothers' \"Who's That Lady\" with a live band for Kendrick Lamar's \"i,\" as well as the established careers of bands like The Roots and badbadnotgood, how do hip hop artists and fans perceive the use of live instrumentation versus sampling, and what factors, as highlighted by Big Daddy Kane's experience with incorporating live drummers and percussionists (specifically his preference for vintage Ludwig Black Oyster or Starlight drum sets), contribute to the successful integration of live bands into hip hop performances and recordings?\"", "combined_text": "Live instrumentation in hip hop Hip-hop has always had a strange relationship with live instrumentation. Before samplers and synthesizers became prominent parts of hip hop production, early hip hop hits such as [\"Rapper's Delight\"](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rKTUAESacQM) (The Sugarhill Gang) and \"The Breaks\" (Kurtis Blow) were recorded with live studio bands. Recently, DJ Dahi, the producer behind Kendrick Lamar's latest single, [\"i\"](http://youtube.com/watch?v=jltN3fLFmTQ), revealed that he did not use any samples on the track, but instead reproduced the Isley Brothers' [\"Who's That Lady\"](http://youtube.com/watch?v=f3Kf1Iy5E6U) with an in-studio band. The consensus in that reddit thread was that this somehow made the track more authentic, or that it made listeners feel different about the song. Bands like The Roots, and more recently, badbadnotgood, have built careers on their use of live instrumentation. Fans of these bands are quick to point out the authenticity of playing the music with \"real instruments\", instead of relying on samples. And for these acts, it's clearly more than a novelty. It has also become commonplace for big-ticket, stadium-filling rappers like [Lil Wayne and Kanye to use live drummers and percussionists](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4MF10-dI6S8) in their stage performances. \n\nRecently, when [Big Daddy Kane was asked about the \"right\" way to incorporate a live band, he said:](http://www.hiphopdx.com/m/index.php?s=news&amp;amp;amp;id=30611)\n\n&gt;“Well, that’s the key, successfully performing with the band. A Hip Hop fan, there is a [tendency] to really just wanna hear the track. So with a live band, if you don’t have the right drummer and the right instruments it can be real ugly. We make sure that we go back and get that old Ludwig Black Oyster or Starlight drum set that they used from the songs that we used to sample back in the days...Well, before me, I’m not gonna say no names, I’ve seen about three different artists try to use bands on stage and it just didn’t look right. Once I finally linked up with a great band, I figured out a way to really make that whole thing work the right way. Where the sound is full and it’s accurate and you feel like it’s the track.”\n\n\nI have no idea what the 46 year old BDK sounds like with his live band, but I think what he said is spot on. It can indeed get ugly. \n\nSo when does it work? When doesn't it work? Personally, I find that most of the time, it's pretty ugly. I can relate to what BDK said about the desire to just 'hear the track', and I don't think that samplers, drum machines, and software are any less 'real' than 'real instruments'. I think there's a tendency with big name acts today to beef up their stage performance by adding more and more live performers, but I find that it usually sounds best with just a skilled DJ. I don't feel gipped if I pay $100 to see Lil Wayne and I don't get to see a real live drummer. I just want it to sound good. I also don't think a track like Kendrick's \"i\" sounds any better than it would have had it used a sample instead of trying to faithfully re-record the original. I think the live instrumentation cheapens the sound, if anything. In that performance of 6 foot 7 I linked above, the effect of drummer and guitarist is complete overkill, turning that frighteningly spartan crunch of [the original beat](http://youtube.com/watch?v=c7tOAGY59uQ) into a clumsy rap-rock chugfest. \n\nWhat do you guys think? \n\n", "score": 30.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/2ial5l/live_instrumentation_in_hip_hop/", "name": "t3_2ial5l", "source_subreddit": "hiphopheads", "submission_entities": {"songs": ["\"Rapper's Delight\"", "\"The Breaks\"", "\"i\"", "\"Who's That Lady\""]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["op", "Wu Tang song", "i", "\"i\"", "Stairway to Heaven", "Lasers", "Trap Back Jumpin", "Rapper's Delight", "sidewalk chalk"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_cl0m2r1", "score": 7.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["op"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl0es5p", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Carnage", "Atmosphere"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Wu Tang song"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl0m2fw", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Dahi"], "albums": [], "songs": ["i"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl0m38d", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Rahki"], "albums": [], "songs": ["\"i\""]}}, {"name": "t1_cl0mbbz", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl0p1f1", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Lupe"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Lasers", "Trap Back Jumpin"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl0ghxs", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Toro Y Moi"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Rapper's Delight"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl0lu1b", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["sidewalk chalk"]}}], "bucket": "other"}

Then I recently discovered [Challenger Part 2 - A Swan Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPtsN4IK4sY) which blew my mind since I didn't think I was going to find a more emotional track that fit the bill. \n\nSince then, was able to poke around and find songs like Gallant Gentleman (We Lost the Sea), New Topia (This Will Destroy You), Glosoli (Sigur Ros), Procellous (Caspian), Ashes in the Snow (MONO), etc. \n\nWondering if anyone had any other hidden gems lying around.

When there is melody it isn't grand in its emotional expression and it is secondary to rhythm.

They also go by the name Danielson Family, as the band is made up of the frontman's wife, daughter, siblings, and friends. The singer has a really high and squeaky voice. Instrumentally, their music is kind of similar to Arcade Fire or Sufjan Stevens. Speaking of Sufjan, he actually used to be in the group before he got well known, and his initiation into the band and rise to success as a solo artist is featured in [the documentary (wikipedia link)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0762087/) about the band.

{"query": "Considering the \"Power Metal\" album, a project described as \"Pantera but it isn't\" or \"Glamtera,\" featuring Dimebag Darrell's guitar playing and potentially divisive vocals reminiscent of Rob Halford, and with a particular appreciation for his lead work comparable to \"The Sleep\" solo, what are your thoughts on Dimebag Darrell's guitar playing on this album, especially regarding the solo in \"Over and Out,\" and do you agree or disagree with the assessment that it's derivative, particularly from the perspective of guitar players", "combined_text": "Do you like Dimebag Darrell? Last year my friend who eats, breaths and shits guitar and I found the album power metal. It is pantera but it isn't. I believe the term is Glamtera. I'm sure some are firmiliar.

I could try to describe to you his lead playing in comparison to the following albums but I'd rather not was your time.\nhttp://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vesdBImFZ6g\n(I apologize for my poor formatting)\nNot the best song but arguably one of his best solos (my opinion) To give you an idea of my taste in lead playing my favorite Dime solo is the sleep. And this one possibly tops it for me.\n Whether your a pantera/dimebag fan or frankly someone who thinks he's overrated I encourage you to check it out. Most people dismiss it as derrivitive crap but I dig it. \nPS if your missing a killer pantera song to your library \"Over and Out\" is worth downloading. I'm interested to hear what you think.\n\nEDIT: I'm especially interested to hear from the guitar players of reddit. Oh and I hope you guys, like me can take some humor from these songs.

{"query": "Considering its masterful pacing, memorable sections like \"Von den Hinterweltlern,\" striking contrasts, and overall power, why doesn't Richard Strauss's *Also Sprach Zarathustra* seem to have achieved a popularity level comparable to Beethoven's 5th, despite its iconic association with *2001: A Space Odyssey*, and what factors might contribute to this relative lack of recordings and recognition, even if some recordings are considered exceptional despite drawbacks like intrusive advertisements", "combined_text": "Why aren't there more recordings of Also Sprach Zarathustra?
