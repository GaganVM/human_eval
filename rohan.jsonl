{"query": "it's a false alarm. The album is a bit too long, and the tracks are too repetitive. The album's sound is a bit too abrasive and harsh, and it's hard to feel any emotional connection with the lyrics. It's a flawed but interesting album. It felt like Nakata was experimenting with new sounds and textures, but the execution was lacking. It's a fascinating case study of an artist pushing boundaries, but ultimately, failing to deliver a cohesive album. It's a shame, because the potential was there. The album features vocals by Toshiko Koshigoe. Toshiko's vocals are generally good, but they are often buried in the production, and sometimes feel like they are fighting against the music. Her performance in \"I know you love me baby\" is a highlight. Her performance in \"I just wanna xxx you\" is... interesting. Toshiko's vocals in \"striker\" is sort of fun, I guess. Toshiko's vocals are generally good, but they are often buried in the production, and sometimes feel like they are fighting against the music. ### Capsule - PERFECTLY CRIME (2012) &gt; I wanna be a star &gt; I wanna", "combined_text": "Yasutaka Nakata Retrospective: Part 3 - Invader Invader [Part 1 - Fashion Fashion](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/zhei65/4_days_later_capsule_are_releasing_their_16th/) - [Part 2 - Take off](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/zi8tea/yasutaka_nakata_retrospective_part_2_take_off/) - **Part 3** - Part 4\n\n---\nWell hello again to the third installment of this series! I originally planned to post this on Monday morning (my time) but then life happened (uni etc.) and also I just kinda wanted to not listen to more electronic music for a couple days so I went and listened to Jubilee etc. and I didn’t feel like writing while listening to something else. Kinda sad I couldn’t finish these before Metropulse but I couldn’t just leave it halfway either! I guess Part 4 will include my thoughts on Metropulse as well. With that out of the way, let’s continue where I left off:\n\n### Capsule - [WORLD OF FANTASY](https://open.spotify.com/album/3VwbNO8dkyY6i0Ui8tZq0R?si=Xqtikt0YSSCg3YGkNBU-eg) (2011)\n\n&gt; I wanna fly away    \n&gt; I know you love me baby\n\nNakata started 2011 with another Capsule album, *WORLD OF FANTASY*. At this point Nakata just ran with whatever he felt like and pushed himself to the brink of his creativity “to keep doing music he liked” and to keep Capsule pure. Well, the end result is an album that doesn’t really resonate with me but if this is the “pure Capsule” then what am I to say against that? My thoughts on this can be summarized as “The intro and the outro are high points in this album”. [The title track](https://youtu.be/W4h8m74pyC8) is also a banger electro house track you’d expect from Nakata. But then the album becomes a challenge of how to enjoy bad music. For example, “I just wanna xxx you” becomes much better when you think of it as (proto-)hyperpop (Narrator voice: it’s not) and the moment when Toshiko shouts out the title in “striker” is sort of fun, I guess. “Keep Hope Alive” makes me hopeful that the rest of the record might have more good songs to come, but unfortunately it’s one good song surrounded by bad songs on both ends. And unlike the previous tracks, I don’t have any delusions about tracks after, such as “I will” and “What is love” though, they simply feel too bland. I can’t say I like “I can’t say I like you” either. “Prime Time” is the last song here and Nakata again puts one of his best songs as the last. You might have noticed that this happens often: ever since *Sugarless GiRL*, every time I complain about songs in his albums, they’re in the middle of the tracklist. *WORLD OF FANTASY* is no different, but unlike past Capsule albums, I think the bad songs on this record outweigh the good ones. Check out the title track, “Keep Hope Alive” and “Prime Time”.\n\n### Kyary Pamyu Pamyu - [Moshi Moshi Harajuku](https://open.spotify.com/album/4ZhxLzAS9sZYQrSfAOu5RK?si=n4NX0RnmTZO6AVUB9rDJ5g) (2011)\n\n&gt; Every Day PON  \n&gt; Every Time is PON\n\nIn case you lived under a rock this past decade and missed out on the phenomenon that was Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, let me give a brief introduction. Kyary was a model who appeared in various magazines, and had been acquainted with Nakata who encouraged her to sing. A couple months after the 2011 earthquake, Kyary released “[PONPONPON](https://youtu.be/yzC4hFK5P3g)”, a song that would bring joy back to Japan. Well, it went beyond: the song was a viral hit globally and catapulted Kyary to a level of celebrity on an international level that even Perfume hadn’t reached, thanks to the power of YouTube. Not even a month after, Kyary’s debut EP *Moshi Moshi Harajuku* was released. “PONPONPON” is the obvious standout, I love this song, and the other highlight here is “Cherry Bon Bon”. The rest of the tracklist I don’t really care much about, there is a cover of Capsule’s “jelly” but it doesn’t really live up to the original. \n\n### Perfume - [JPN](https://open.spotify.com/album/6BgdG33FAt1KEuZ4VvYHj8?si=caf6640fef754e72) (2011)\n\n&gt; Can’t stop feeling  \n&gt; Fushizen na Girl\n\nAfter *Triangle*’s release in 2009, Perfume were again very quick on getting their new singles out: “Fushizen na Girl/Natural ni Koishite” was released in spring 2010, almost 2 years before the release of *JPN*. They didn’t lose their speed and released three more singles – and then one final one as the “lead” single for the album. So when “JPN” was released on 30 November 2011, nine of the 14 tracks were already available as singles or B-sides (the B-side to “Nee” didn’t make it). I don’t know how their contract works, but I assume that part of the scheduling is the pressure on idol groups to release fresh material. So without an album even planned, Perfume had released four singles already, which makes *JPN* lose some of the album strength *GAME* and *Triangle* had. It’s reminiscent of *Complete Best* but that record had the novelty of being their debut. \n\nTo be perfectly honest, I don’t think any Perfume project would’ve met my expectations from them after *Triangle*, though *JPN* has its fair share of good songs: “[Laser Beam](https://youtu.be/K54CYowOqxM)” is a great opener with some bit-type melodies mixed in, which are also present in the following track “[Glitter](https://youtu.be/H3RBn3MG8ms)”. “[Nee](https://youtu.be/nbeGeXgjh9Q)\" has these chopped up vocals that I really enjoy. “[Natural ni Koushite](https://youtu.be/PXAlCazm3J0)” has some R&amp;B vibes interwoven with Nakata’s electropop and “575” has the group dabble into hip hop, as Kashiyuka raps on two verses. “[Fushizen na Girl](https://youtu.be/kfqToOh7MVA)” is an iconic Perfume synthpop-electropop song, probably my favorite here. The closer “[Spice](https://youtu.be/biMO46z_VSY)” mixes the synthpop from Fushizen and the bitpop from Glitter, one of the best tracks here imo. All the aforementioned tracks were singles, but the album’s deep cuts do not compliment them very well, unfortunately. “Have a Stroll” and “My Color” fit in with the glitchy theme going on but they feel a bit underwhelming compared to the singles, “Kokoro no Sports” feels a little bit generic and I don’t even know what is happening in “Toki no Hari”. I always thought of *JPN* as an album without a distinct identity before, though that’s not really true. The bit music parts feel fresh, and if it was a bit more honed in that aspect I think I would’ve really liked this album. As it stands it’s still a pretty good album, but I don’t really feel attached to this one like the other Perfume records that came before it. \n\n### Capsule - [STEREO WORXXX](https://open.spotify.com/album/1zW0kOHEapGiBRJNvbygek?si=rjB_ihKBQLayRuf9GirK5g) (2012)\n\n&gt; P- p- p- pumping pumping  \n&gt; S- s- s- swinging swinging  \n&gt; J- j- just moving moving  \n&gt; Tapping beats\n\nAfter the personal let down I had with *WORLD OF FANTASY*, Capsule won me over yet again with *STEREO WORXXX*. This is the first Capsule album without an intro, an outro or an interlude. It’s just nine full songs and then ride over. That doesn’t mean the album flow is bad, however: this might be the most consistent Capsule project since *FRUITS CLiPPER*! The first three songs are Nakata doing his electro house magic, “In The Rain” has a more atmospheric vibe that’s not very usual for Nakata but it’s lovely. Even the rather repetitive cut “Dee J” feels like a step up from *WoF* and *PLAYER*’s worst, because a) it’s not 6+ minutes long and b) there is a switch-up near the end that is quite fun. “Step on the Floor” has a chorus and verses which, you know, I like those things as a pop listener, and the production is neat. The lines in “Tapping Beats” have these repeating first syllables (showcased above) which are fun. Next up is “All The Way”, I just think it’s a good song, it is followed by the entirely instrumental “Motor Force” which – could’ve gone a lot worse – but it is alright. The section around 2 minutes into the track saves it for me. “Transparent” closes the album with a rather low tempo disco beat, as if the club has closed and we’re packing things up. Nakata closers just don’t miss. \n\nI didn’t really feel the need to mention this before, but Nakata had his own label Contemode ever since 2003. Contemode was a subsidiary of Yamaha (you might remember the competition Nakata won)  and released all of Capsule’s albums bar *High Collar Girl*, Coltemonikha EPs (and a compilation in 2011) and some other projects of Nakata’s friends. In 2013, Nakata would change labels to unBORDE, a subsidiary of Warner Japan, and Contemode was defunct. So in that sense, *STEREO WORXXX* is the end of an era, and for that reason I’m so glad it’s this good.\n\n### Kyary Pamyu Pamyu - [Pamyu Pamyu Revolution](https://open.spotify.com/album/0dYoEirIRah6OKJl1okk6Z?si=mwz1QbIVQYuNfYLVk63vEA) (2012)\n\n&gt; Candy candy candy candy candy  \n&gt; Sweetie sweetie girls love\n\nSpeaking of unBORDE, they released Kyary’s proper debut album in May 2022. Out of all the songs in *Moshi Moshi*, only “PONPONPON” made it to *Pamyu Pamyu Revolution*, which is probably for the best. This project is excellent. Nakata really knew how to play to the strengths of Kyary and “PONPONPON”. The singles for the album “[Tsukema Tsukeru](https://youtu.be/NLy4cvRx7Vc)” and “[CANDY CANDY](https://youtu.be/UoK8DaJRDaM)” are the prime example of this, just incredibly cute bubblegum pop all around. The B-side track to “Tsukema Tsukeru”, “Kyary ANAN” is another catchy song with its repetitive chorus that gets itched into your brain and some instruments coming from out of the blue such as the guitars in the middle of the song. I love it. This album also showcases a change in Nakata’s songwriting approach: this album manages to be cutesy without incorporating the sounds of early Capsule records such as *Cutie Cinema*. Well, some songs like “Drinker” still carry that influence, but they’re outnumbered by the more disco oriented pop tracks such as “Suki Sugite Kire Sou” and the incredible closer “Chan Chaka Chan Chan”. The one outlier on this album is “Oyasumi” (which is not a cover of Capsule’s “Oyasumi”), this song goes a bit too much on the childish performance aspect for me. But *Pamyu Pamyu Revolution* manages to be just that, a revolution that made Kyary a pop-culture icon. \n\n### Kyary Pamyu Pamyu - [Nanda Collection](https://open.spotify.com/album/284CrOYQvoB5GQAcmx5Xkx?si=N2VWKT5sSqaEPc-Wk8jQzw) (2013)\n\n&gt; Doushite ninja ri bang bang  \n&gt; Ai shite ninja ri bang bang\n\nKyary followed her *Revolution* with *Nanda Collection*, a word play between Japanese question “Nan da kore? (It’s like a surprised way of saying “What is this?”, implies the thing is random or weird)” and the Japanese spelling of collection (korekushon). The album starts off with “[Ninja Re Bang Bang](https://youtu.be/teMdjJ3w9iM)” and what a start it is! This might be my favorite Kyary song. It was a big hit too: does your fave have a song in John Wick? (well if your fave is Rina Sawayama then I can’t say much but) The cultural impact woah! Anyways, moving on, there is a cover of Capsule’s “Super Scooter Happy” and while I don’t think it’s as good as the original (none of the Kyary covers of Capsule have the same impact for me), this one is still a fun moment in the context of the album. “[Invader Invader](https://youtu.be/jcIOg_m-bp4)” is the last single the album had, it has this quirky electronic breakdown in the middle that’s a moment, and the rest of it is pure fun. “Me” has this very techno sounding loop deep in the mix which reminds me of the [Devilman Crybaby OP](https://youtu.be/SM5mnH7JrJE) of all things, more importantly it’s Kyary doing denpa so it’s obviously a banger. And then it ties into a march section! Is this Paprika? Wild. Following “Me” is “[Fashion Monster](https://youtu.be/GivkxpAVVC4)” which has a very high energy hook, it’s one of her most popular songs for a reason. “Saigo no Icecream” is great dance-pop, “Noriko and Norio” is an eclectic Shibuya-kei return, “[Furisodation](https://youtu.be/9Y6H-YjsE9Q)” dabbles with pop rock as Kyary sings about turning 20 (the age of being an adult), “Kurakura” is circus music (complimentary) and the closer “Otona na Kodomo” is a childish dance track reminiscent of her first album. I assume it’s about her parents, since the song title translates to “Parent’s Child” and the last song was about her coming of age. Anyways, *Nanda Collection* is an album that recognized a repeat of *Revolution* wouldn’t work as well, so it’s diverse and explores many different sounds. It’s a great step up for Kyary as much as I like *Revolution*, this has to be her best. Pitchfork gave this album a 6.6 in their [review](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18369-kyary-pamyu-pamyu-nanda-collection/) which doesn’t seem too impressive but more importantly: they reviewed it! A first from a Western publisher to review a Nakata project as far as I know. \n\n### Capsule - [CAPS LOCK](https://youtu.be/PCVaS9qSLSI) (2013)\n\n&gt; Unreal at the dance studio  \n&gt; Soon avocado dream he cook-cooked\n\nIn my *High Collar Girl* write-up in the first post, I mentioned how that album was the album that stands out the most sonically in Nakata’s repertoire. Well, this album challenges that claim and probably wins? This is again another album not on streaming, so I didn’t give this one much attention until recently. What happened with *CAPS LOCK* is that Nakata embraced his inner Aphex Twin which is kind of obvious from the album cover now that I think about it. “[Control](https://youtu.be/A2sFSiaS65E)” and “Shift” are similar to “5ive Star” and “dreamin dreamin” from *CLiPPER* in that they lean towards pop structures as much as they explore the new soundscapes of the record, but the rest of the tracklist is mostly braindance tracks, so I don’t even feel comfortable explaining them. I’d say check out the two mentioned tracks, and if you like them, check out the rest of the record. I enjoy this quite a bit but I’m biased as Aphex Twin was my top artist this year (I listen to Ambient Selected Works II a lot when reading or sleeping). \n\n### Perfume - [LEVEL3](https://open.spotify.com/album/2DdXcewGp8Akqutak3yLDg?si=dOcaz2CHRB2e8OK8k5Tp3Q) (2013)\n\n&gt; Spending all my time  \n&gt; Loving you forever\n\nCapsule wasn't the only act that would go with a label change around this time. In 2012, Perfume left Tokuma and joined Universal Japan to gain more international fame. They released their first compilation album as an overseas release, and a new single “[Spending All My Time](https://youtu.be/H4znsXCH_2Y) was dedicated to overseas fans. The beginning of this song makes me think “Party Rock Anthem” just started playing. I haven’t decided if that’s a good or a bad thing yet. The B-side track “Hurly Burly” is great, although it didn’t make it to the album for some reason. There are actually a lot of “for some reason”s in this album to unpack.\n\nI don’t know if Nakata actually took inspiration from global trends to make Perfume more marketable to a Western audience, but it sure seems like it. The opener is a 3 and a half minute EDM “intro” with barely any vocals, feels a bit odd coming from Perfume and it foreshadows most of my thoughts on this album. The next two tracks make the problem clear: it feels like Nakata drowned Perfume in this album. “[Spring of Life](https://youtu.be/7PtvnaEo9-0)” and “[Magic of Love](https://youtu.be/NhI2mp-WIck)” were both very fun singles that get unnecessarily long and muddled with the album versions. They don’t feel like Perfume songs, in a way: Nakata is the centerpiece and the girls are just trying to sing over a composition that drowns their vocals (in the album cuts). The “waa waa”s in “Clockwork” feel lazy, “1mm” has a similar vocalizing part executed better. “Party Maker” is a 7 minute festival EDM track, with claps, drops etc. Comparing this to something like “edge” and the difference is night and day: in “edge” there were long instrumental sections, but you could feel them building up to the parts where Perfume would return. This song is **the** instrumental part, the girls are just there doing I don’t even know what as the song builds up to the drop. I’m not a festival EDM anti – I bop to this song regardless – but this song lacks a certain synergy Perfume used to have. “Furikaeru to Iru yo” would’ve been Perfume’s best song if it only had a Sean Paul feature but alas. “Point” is a drum &amp; bass track that reminds me of “Teleportation” from *L.D.K.* and it also doesn’t mess with the girls’ vocals so it’s great! “Daijobanai” has a very catchy hook and good vibes all around, probably my favorite on the album. This album reminds me of *Sugarless GiRL* with its vocal sampling: there is none of that in this album but there might as well have been as the girls have been thrown aside for a Nakata show, and as much as I like his compositions, this is not a step up for Perfume. And just like *Sugarless GiRL*, *LEVEL3* is a good album that showcased a few symptoms in Nakata’s songwriting for Perfume that would resurface in future albums. \n\n##### Sheena Ringo collab\n\nSo in 2013, Sheena Ringo (famous Japanese singer, one of my favorite artists) released a compilation album that consisted of collaborations that she did in the 15 years of her music career. “[Netsuai Hakkakuchuu](https://youtu.be/kw8FiEUgSII)” wasn’t one of these songs, but Sheena asked Nakata for a collaboration so they made one and put it on the album as a new track. I adore this track but I can’t tell how much of it is just me liking both Sheena and Nakata and adoring this little collab they put out. At the beginning it’s still barely reminiscent of Sheena’s style but it just derails into a bass-heavy Nakata cut with Sheena singing. If this is your first exposure to Sheena and you like it, great! If you don’t like it, ignore it and go listen to [this album](https://open.spotify.com/album/2i4fy6a51XTaZOYA8rIdRK?si=jNHYE1bJSeitUBTih1TgGw) pretty please… Everyone who has a bit of interest in art pop has to listen to this like it’s incredible how good this album is. It’s actually better than any of these albums I wrote about – maybe I should’ve done a post on Sheena instead. Oh well. \n\n### Kyary Pamyu Pamyu - [Pika Pika Fantajin](https://open.spotify.com/album/3v6YUUTE2UWuIAnGo8m5fu?si=h2fRu0_zRea3gtZ0ljvchQ) (2014)\n\nThe final act of the Pamyu Pamyu trilogy, *Pika Pika Fantajin*, is even more confusing than an album that had “what the heck” in its title, and this time not in a good way. The album starts with a Disney-esque fanfare intro track, which is so disjointed with the follow up track “[Kira Kira Killer](https://youtu.be/eryOLPafXNc). “Kira Kira” is a fun Kyary song, but it doesn’t have the same oomph that “PONPONPON” or “Ninja Re Bang Bang” had. Neither does “Yume no Hajima Ring Ring” which sounds like a song about saying farewell to your toys (makes me think of that one Toy Story scene) but I haven’t actually checked if that’s the actual topic. This song is nice but again, a 180-flip from the last song and another 180-flip to the next song, “[Mottai Night Land](https://youtu.be/7bFHzDa9U9w)” which is another upbeat pop bop. “Serious Hitomi” then puts on the rock sensibilities Kyary had on *Nanda*, might be my favorite song here but – and I keep mentioning this – it feels out of place in the tracklist. A “do do pi do” cover is next, and again it’s not bad but the Capsule version outsold. “[Ring a Bell](https://youtu.be/eDh2Lg3RmAM)” is another bubblegum dance track that won me over and it’s a nice one-two with “Tokyo Highway”. The last three tracks connect the dots with the fanfare in the intro, showcasing a performer Kyary a la “Oyasumi” from *Revolution*, I personally don’t care much about these three but the closer with its marching beat would be my pick. *Fantajin* really suffers from not having the standout track the previous two did imo, and the tracklisting doesn’t help it either. Not a terrible release, pretty good collection of songs, not my kind of album.\n\n### Capsule - [WAVE RUNNER](https://open.spotify.com/album/4Z65vZZR8Ec3RQv9qiyqdC?si=NR5HtOFdRHeO6Kbylf4t-w) (2015)\n\n&gt; Open your eyes up today  \n&gt; I'm swimming in the sea of myself\n\nCapsule’s last album before their 6 year hiatus, *WAVE RUNNER*, is a stark contrast to *CAPS LOCK* in that the latter was a more experimental record, this one is for the crowds who want to jump and dance. Fun fact about this album: it’s their lowest rated album by a wide margin on RYM. It’s also dubbed with the genre “Big Room House” (I frankly get confused with their genre system beyond a certain point but think Swedish House Mafia, Martin Garrix etc.) and is the highest rated album within this genre. So that made me chuckle. Does it deserve the title of their worst album? Oh, definitely not. “[Another World](https://youtu.be/LZ6-PfPx0EM)” and “Hero” are the defining bangers of this album, the robotic vocals in the latter are such a nice touch and make it bop so much harder. Other than those two songs, the rest of the album might be a bit forgettable maybe? They feel safe, have a build-up, have the drop, rinse and repeat. I don’t think these tracks are bad, they just don’t feel very suited to me listening to them on my headphones. *WAVE RUNNER* very clearly had the idea of playing at venues, festivals etc. and feels like an album Nakata made to have music more suitable for those kinds of events. He even mentions something similar to that in [an interview](https://ko-fi.com/post/CAPSULES-interview-excerpt-from-realsound-jp-2021-I3I65GV2U). \n\n##### Final thoughts / Questions\n\nA lot of people seem to consider the 2010s as the decade when Nakata “fell off”. That seems to stem from people’s thoughts of the EDM boom that happened simultaneously in the West: Nakata’s status as a visionary DJ became jumbled with one of a trend chaser. Would you agree? I personally think that even though the range of influences got more varied and the Western EDM definitely played a part, Nakata still had his signature sound, and more importantly, his partners who bring their own artistry to the mix. Well, regardless of his acclaim, this was a big era for these artists’ popularity, especially through Kyary’s viral status. Kyary by herself is a whole another discussion point too. Did she give rise to children's music in the mainstream (*cough cough* Bonito Generation, Peppa Pig, we love the silly things that they do to make you smile the way you do) by herself? Truly a pioneer. So with that we have concluded Kyary’s main trilogy (her next album is a compilation in 2016, then an actual release was in 2018, 4 years after *Pika Pika*) and all of Capsule’s albums that exist so far. The next post is relatively light, but we are going crazy with a very unexpected feature… See you then! \n\nWell, I’ve made these ordering things common so a go through list of mentioned albums:\n\n1.

Most of his beats he makes completely from scratch, rarely sampling. He uses this process called Associative Music, where he uses sounds from totally random things and makes them into awesome tracks. He actually used a piano melody, [which came from a rat walking on a piano. In addition to using the rats heartbeat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_5Ty_2xGFM)\nHe has a pretty cool signature sound, and chances are you've heard his work if you're into Big Baby Gandhi, Heems, Lakutis, etc. If you wanna check out any more of his stuff, his two best projects (IMO) are out for free on bandcamp.

My debut record 'Tethers' just came out, AMA! Hi, I'm Kip. I used to write and sing songs in The Pains of Being Pure at Heart. But after recording our last album in 2016, I had a daughter, moved from Brooklyn, NY to Princeton, NJ, and spent most of my time just staying home and hanging out with her. When I did pick up my guitar, it was mostly to sing her silly songs, and when I played for myself after bedtime, the kinds of things that came out were pretty different than what I did in my previous band. \n\nSo in 2018, I recorded some of those new songs I had written, but the day after I finished up in the studio, my son was born (a bit early). So I stayed home with him until 2020, when I was about to put out this record and then... well, 2020. So here I am starting a new thing, but just a bit later than I originally thought.\n\nI recorded 'Tethers' without any effects pedals or metronomes, and most of it is just live. I could ascribe some fancy artistic reason for that, but honestly I didn't have a lot of time and just thought plugging in my guitar and playing the songs with my friends as best we could was the quickest way to do it. \n\nI'm happy to talk about The Natvral, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, My Little Pony, or anything! \n\nStream 'Tethers'\nSpotify:

It was pretty intense stuff that the crowd wasn't prepared for coming into it. \n\n\nHere's a few examples:\n\n[Ascension](https://soundcloud.com/obrother/ascension): Probably their most popular tune over the years. That bending swoop sound (sorry if there's actually a name for this type of sound) at 6:22-6:23 chills me to the bone every single time. \n\n\n[Oh Charitable Thief](https://soundcloud.com/obrother/oh-charitable-thief): This is the song that they reeled me in with. The final climax is so satisfying.\n\n\n[Lay Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UifrckJBjS0): Just a great well-rounded O'Brother song that conveys their best qualities. The instrumental break is perfect. \n\n\n[Easy Talk \\(Open Your Mouth\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N03ZD1-rR0): My Favorite track on this album. The flow is amazing.\n\n\n[Cleanse Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OB8oKLxS5c): A 14 minute epic journey.

Ok this one needs some disclaimer : when the game came out the OST was released on a proper CD under the title 'Dune : A Spice Opera'. Unfortunately, the CD versions are not as good as the in-game ones. The CD basically sounds like discount Jean-Michel Jarre imo, but the in-game music is dope. It's available in several versions because of the different soundcards used at that time. You'll find four different in-game versions on Youtube, plus some tracks from the Amiga versions. There's also [some files on the VGMPF site](http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=Dune_(DOS)), because the game is abandonware anyway.

What are some works of the renaissance and baroque that the whole of music and humankind just couldn't do without, pieces/songs that defined the art of composition and were the epitome of their form, similar to how many of Beethoven's piano sonatas are considered the greatest of their form in the piano repertoire? I'm especially curious as to which works by Palestrina, Bach, and Handel would be considered the quintessential works in compositional technique and advancement. Bach's Art of Fugue and Handel's Messiah are two that come to mind as something I feel like could be on this list, although I haven't done much study on what musically would make them \"peaks\" in baroque music and have no reason for them other than how widely discussed/popular they are. Of course, much of what great composers wrote were revolutionary at the time, but what could be filtered to be the most revolutionary and significant to music?\n\nI guess this could be tagged as a discussion, but I'm moreover making recommendation requests for great baroque music that you can't experience the world of music to the fullest without hearing.\n\nIt's free real estate so let me recommend the [overture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfXJMua2wzM) of Bach's BWV 831, one of the most structurally and melodically beautiful pieces I've heard.

Yet through quiet and droning flow and production, there is an almost intense atmosphere created in the heavy word play pertaining to Chess, and heavy and tribal-esque leading guitar and piano loops.\nNight's Gambit is definitely not a catchy album but yet grows on you through more listens\n\nListen to this album!!!! its probably my favorite album from last year and Ka has one of the nicest voice and beats on his stuff. \n\nFavorites from the album:\n\n[30 Pieces of Silver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_glHS0P_5Q)\n\n[Jungle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOXmELcrXg0)\n\n[Nothing is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb884kPiw6Q)", "score": 26.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/2iz65c/ka_nights_gambit_full_album/", "name": "t3_2iz65c", "source_subreddit": "hiphopheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Roc Marciano", "GZA", "Night's Gambit", "Ka"], "albums": ["Night's Gambit (full album)"], "songs": ["30 Pieces of Silver", "Jungle"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Off the Record", "Night's Gambit", "Every", "Peace", "Crawl", "3005"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_cl6tp41", "score": 6.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Ka"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Off the Record"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6wwix", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": ["Grief Pedigree"], "songs": ["Night's Gambit"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6wxar", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Every"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6z3m5", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Peace Akhi"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Peace"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl7a7lc", "score": 0.0, "entities": {"artists": ["BT"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Crawl", "3005"]}}], "bucket": "pop_culture"}

The six-member band, fronted by singer-songwriter Adam Granduciel, found critical success in 2011 with their sophomore record *Slave Ambient,* and their enigmatic style of heartland rock has only grown in scope and acclaim since. Their 2014 album *Lost in the Dream* was a true breakout moment and cemented their status as a strong artistic force in the 2010s music landscape, laying the groundwork for the massive success of their Grammy-winning, chart-topping 2017 record *A Deeper Understanding.* Now firmly rooted at Atlantic Records, the band has returned after a four-year interval with...\n\n**WHY:** Their latest album *I Don't Live Here Anymore,* just released today, featuring the singles \"[Living Proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3OEofsCur8)\" and \"[I Don't Live Here Anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVh6XTwWhMY)\". The record finds the group continuing to expand the scope of their gritted, down-to-earth style, fine-tuning their craft and deepening their search for empathy and comfort against the increasing alienation of daily life. The band has also planned an extensive tour throughout the US &amp; Europe in early 2022, [with information about dates and tickets listed on their official website.](https://www.thewarondrugs.net/tour)\n\n**WHEN:** The War on Drugs will join us this upcoming Monday, November 1st at 1pm ET/10am PT!", "score": 197.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/qig1zu/ama_announcement_the_war_on_drugs_on_monday/", "name": "t3_qig1zu", "source_subreddit": "indieheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["The War on Drugs", "Adam Granduciel"], "albums": ["Slave Ambient", "Lost in the Dream", "A Deeper Understanding", "I Don't Live Here Anymore"], "songs": ["Living Proof", "I Don't Live Here Anymore"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["\"woo!\"", "Victim", "Under the preshaaa WOO", "WOO!", "WOD", "WOO!", "WOOHOO", "Stairway to Heaven", "Stairway to Heaven", "\"woo", "alright\"", "Stairway to Heaven", "WOOHOO", "Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_hij3cog", "score": 52.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["\"woo!\""]}}, {"name": "t1_hiju12a", "score": 8.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Victim"]}}, {"name": "t1_hijgahn", "score": 7.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Under the preshaaa WOO"]}}, {"name": "t1_hijq4es", "score": 7.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["WOO!"]}}, {"name": "t1_hij98gt", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["WOD", "WOO!"]}}, {"name": "t1_hijah8j", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["WOOHOO"]}}, {"name": "t1_hijhihw", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_hijzwba", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_hioy5rt", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["\"woo", "alright\""]}}, {"name": "t1_hioyqqp", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": ["living proof"], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_hiswmei", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["WOOHOO"]}}, {"name": "t1_hijdqu7", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}], "bucket": "pop_culture"}

It's widely known for its explicit lyrics and the very controversial music video, that was basically a teaser to what would be the Sex Book and the album, released simultaneously some weeks later.\n\nThe song marks the continuation of spoken word and whispering vocals that Madonna used in her singles Justify My Love and Rescue Me two years before and would be present and some other songs in the album. The video was banned from MTV because of this explicit content and even today on YouTube, the video is censored with black bars and editing.\n\nThe dark and experimental production with heavy hip hop influence, the cleverness of the lyrics and the vocal delivery was praised by the critics, with some pointing that this direction wasn't a surprise after the release of I'm Breathless, the Blond Ambition Tour and Justify My Love. But, at the same time, she faced a huge backlash from the GP and radios, that would extend with the release of the album, with some people saying that she had gone too far and that she had killed her career. The song peaked at #3 on Billboard Hot 100, but it was the fastest lead single from her since 1984 up to that time to drop off the charts.\n\nIt's undeniable how influential this song and the parent album is on pop music today, especially with female pop stars who sings sexually explicit songs. The whole *good girl gone bad* vibe in which some popstars go is always compared to what Madonna did here.

{"query": "Considering my enjoyment of progressive rock and metal bands like Thank You Scientist, Diablo Swing Orchestra, and Trioscapes - particularly their jazz influences and DSO's classical music elements (especially evident in their broader catalog and songs like \"A Tapdancer's Dilemma\" and \"Voodo Mon Amour,\" and TYS's \"Suspicious Waveforms\") - what jazz groups, ideally with avant-garde tendencies and a blend of jazz and classical sounds, would you recommend as a next step for someone coming from that musical background", "combined_text": "Getting Into Jazz, Coming From Prog Rock I apologize if this is not the correct place for this but I've been searching for a better place to post this and I can find it. Now onto the substance of my post.\n\nI've been listening to Progressive Rock and Metal for the last 4 years or so and have really taken a liking to the bands that are mixing more jazz into their sound, namely [Thank You Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGvDpr13U2s), [Diablo Swing Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhYiANz5oeI), and [Trioscapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reyZ5DqSyvs).  I also really enjoy the very obvious influence from classical music in DSO's music, it is much more noticeable in their other works namely [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZyDQxM-Zo) one.  \n\nWhat jazz groups are out there that are along the lines of the styles played by the bands I linked?

Can you hear any Jazz influences on their most acclaimed album \"[Meantime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlbunmCbTBA)\"? \n\nAre there any other influential acts in the punk, metal, or rock genres that do not overtly display any kind of jazz aesthetic but nonetheless take some cues from the genre (kinds of chords, interplay) that only really deep jazz fans can pick up on?", "score": 4.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/leyhtd/in_what_ways_has_jazz_influenced_other_genres/", "name": "t3_leyhtd", "source_subreddit": "jazz", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Television", "Helmet"], "albums": ["Marquee Moon", "Meantime"], "songs": ["Marquee Moon", "\"Meantime\""]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Sincerely"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_gmj4tzy", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["That Guy"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Sincerely"]}}], "bucket": "music"}

It picks up again later in the song as well.\n\n[GENESIS - The Fountain of Salmacis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpILkBBve7k) This song also sounds like something that would easily have an influence on heavy metal, NWOBHM and Prog metal.

{"query": "Considering the recent Pitchfork article and playlist highlighting indie music that passes the Bechdel Test (requiring at least one female-identifying lead performer, lyrics involving women or a female audience, and a central theme unrelated to men), and acknowledging the playlist's limited scope (primarily pop music and songs released after 1994), can anyone recommend other indie songs that meet these criteria, similar to the examples provided - Young Wonder's \"To You,\" The Dresden Dolls' \"Girl,\" and Colleen Green's \"I Want to Grow Up\"", "combined_text": "Indie Music that Passes the Bechdel Test So Pitchfork just dropped an article and playlist about music that passes the Bechdel Test: http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/699-a-bechdel-test-for-music/\n\nTypical blog bruhaha aside, I think this is a pretty cool idea and a great way to highlight otherwise underrated and lesser-known musicians. The playlist they have is lacking a bit of variety (no songs before 1994 and mostly stays within in the world of pop) so I was wondering if we could offer up songs that pass the test on our own. \n\nHere are the steps to pass:\n\n1.

[Reddit wasn't the only place to hate this album](https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/review-chief-keef-s-almighty-so-news.7726.html); I think universally after Chief Keef got dropped from Interscope, pretty much everyone wrote him off as a potential young GOAT that threw away all of his potential. \n\n\nHowever, almost 8 years later, you can see the influence of this tape on the new generation of rappers.[ A song like \"I Kno\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwIa5j5irHk) arguably started the baby voice that Playboi Carti's [Pissy Pamper](https://vimeo.com/497383450) and [Molly/No Stylist](https://vimeo.com/562644449) would eventually popularize almost six years later. Listening to an older Carti song like \"[Heavy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxhHQLKnLy0)\" also lets you draw parallells with a song like \"[Nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEtSlJb-7yI)\". And then, there's direct homages/tributes to Keef.  [A song like UnoTheActivist's \"Filling Me Up\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoKYHGBx7WU) is a direct reference to [\"Me\" off of Almighty so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nIk17p0wgs). [Lucki's Days B4 III's cover](https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2019/10/Lucki-Days-B4-III-1572019672.jpg) is a [direct copy of the Almighty So cover](http://kollegekidd.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Chief-Keef-almighty-so-cover-1024x1024.png), and the sounds of the beats within are very similar to some of the beats that you'd find on Almighty So. \n\nOther Chief Keef songs/eras influence artists like Lil Uzi as well, but I just wanted to document some sounds I thought were direct influences on other songs/albums. \n\n**Keeping this in mind, what albums do you think that have been ignored or poorly received will prove to be influential in the coming years?** Hip hop is evolving faster than it ever has been, and we've been seeing that just because there's a consensus that something sounds bad in the culture doesn't mean that a young kid will hear it and come up with their own popular sound influenced by that.\n\nEdit: To clarify what I mean by poorly received, it can be either critics panning it or a fan consensus that it was bad. Doesn't have to be both critics and fans shitting on it.", "score": 411.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/r6heta/discussion_what_poorly_received_projects_from_the/", "name":

{"query": "What movie trailers, regardless of the film's quality or the song's release date relative to the movie's setting, have you felt functioned as a particularly perfect and evocative music video for a specific song, similar to how the *Licorice Pizza* trailer utilized David Bowie's *Life on Mars?*, *Cloud Atlas* used M83's *Outro*, *The Social Network* featured a Scala &amp; Kolacny Brothers cover of Radiohead's *Creep*, or *Easy A* incorporated Lady Gaga's *Poker Face*", "combined_text": "What Movie trailers acted as the perfect music video for a song? This post is really inspired by the new [trailer](https://youtu.be/AMcwN94D_mY) for the upcoming movie *Licorice Pizza*which featured David Bowie’s *Life on Mars?* throughout the whole trailer. I thought  it was such a perfect fit of a song for this trailer to show off the characters and story, and the fact that the movie itself is set in the early 70’s around when the song was released made it feel almost like a proper music video for it too. \n\nThis had me think of some of my other favorite movie trailer songs:\n\nM83’s *Outro* used in [*Cloud Atlas*’s trailer](https://youtube/hWnAqFyaQ5s). This track is incredibly grand, ethereal, and surreal that I don’t think any other visual medium aside from this movie would have done the song justice.\n\nRadiohead’s *Creep* covered by Scala &amp; Kolacny Brothers choir for [*The Social Network* ](https://youtu.be/lB95KLmpLR4). \n\nAnd just because I am obsessed with the movie I feel like I have to include it: [*Easy A*’s](https://youtu.be/KNbPnqyvItk) use of Lady Gaga’s *Poker Face* in the 2nd half of the trailer worked really well with the tone the movie was trying to set for itself. \n\n\nI’m curious if anyone else has movie trailers that felt like the perfect music video for a song.

Hi /r/classicalmusic,\n\nI started listening to classical music as background music when studying, and have grown quite fond of it. That being said, while I could listen to some pieces on repeat without enjoying them any less, there are some that put me off immediately.\n\nI was hoping someone who is more familiar with classical music could point me in the direction of composers or particular styles/pieces of music that I'd enjoy.

I've enjoyed the most. If there are more pieces like this, I would be very pleased to hear them.\n\nI'm not sure how prominent they are in classical music (forgive my ignorance), but I adore pianos.

{"query": "\" --- **Generated Question:** Considering my appreciation for epic, mood-enhancing classical music similar to the *Lord of the Rings* soundtrack by Howard Shore, the *Halo: Combat Evolved* soundtrack, and the *Pirates of the Caribbean* soundtrack, and given my enjoyment of hip-hop incorporating string instruments and horns (like Jay-Z's *Blueprint II*), as well as epic rock ballads reminiscent of Metallica, what classical composers or specific pieces, known for telling a story and building to an epic climax, would you recommend that I can listen to at full volume to appreciate the beauty and harmony of the instruments", "combined_text": "Suggestions For Epic Classical Pieces Hello /r/ClassicalMusic. I have always been a fan of classical music, but have just recently really found to enjoy it. I'm a huge fan of music that brings a rise out of my spirits and music that I can envision being played during a battle of sorts. Epic music, that when listened to enthralls my mood. I fell in love with the LOTR sound track by Howard Shore and have always been a huge fan of the Halo: Combat evolved soundtrack. I remember really enjoying the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack as well. I am curious if you all can help me find some composers, or singles, that fit this description. \n\nA little about my taste that may help. I listen to music to fit my mood. So I love hip-hop at times and I really enjoy hiphip songs that incorporate some form of string instruments and horns. Jay-z blueprint II is a perfect example of this, with the background music being yo-yo ma (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sogcfbqvsw&amp;list=RD7sogcfbqvsw#t=0). I listen to rock at times and enjoy epic rock ballads. No screaming rock that talks about self hate and such. More Metallica type rock, where each song is lengthy and epic beyond proportion.  \n\nI'm looking for classical songs that tell a story and build up to an epic climax. Epic music. Something that will get me to stand up and just lose it while I'm pretend playing the Maestro. Classical pieces that I can turn full volume on and just hear every beautiful instrument being played in perfect harmony. Any suggestions would be great! Thanks! \n\nEDIT: I have some responding to do. Thanks for all of your suggestions! One I found, that I have heard and enjoyed in the past, is Luciano Pavarotti - Turandot - Puccini - Nessun dorma (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMD_5UzjdqQ.)\n\nEDIT II: Really impressed with this subreddit. Was never expecting this many responses and almost deleted it after posting, thinking you all would just tell me to google it. I will get to all of these when I have time and couldn't be more thrilled to have some more epic pieces to add to my library. I would never have known about a lot of these otherwise and it's greatly appreciated. \n", "score": 2.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/2iwsek/suggestions_for_epic_classical_pieces/", "name": "t3_2iwsek", "source_subreddit": "classicalmusic", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Howard Shore", "Hal Jordan", "Jerry Goldsmith", "Jay-Z", "Luciano Pavarotti", "Metallica", "Yo-Yo Ma"], "albums": ["The Lord of the Rings Soundtrack", "Halo: Combat Evolved Original Soundtrack", "Pirates of the Caribbean Soundtrack"], "songs": ["Nessun dorma", "Stairway to Heaven"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Siegfried's death", "Funeral march", "O Fortuna", "Carmina Burana", "Conan The Barbarian - OST", "October", "Joshua", "Sheherazade", "Symphony 5", "Turandot", "Shostakovich 7", "last movement", "Death and Transfiguration", "Dies Irae", "3rd symphony", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Pines of Rome", "Stairway to Heaven", "Also Sprach Zarathustra", "3rd Symphony", "5th Symphony", "6th Symphony", "9th Symphony", "Death and the Maiden", "Stairway to Heaven"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_cl68473", "score": 6.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Richard Wagner", "Richard Strauss", "Carl Orff"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Siegfried's death", "Funeral march", "O Fortuna", "Carmina Burana", "Conan The Barbarian - OST"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6c03k", "score": 5.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Shostakovich", "Mussorgsky", "Rimsky-Korsakov", "Prokofiev", "Puccini"], "albums": [], "songs": ["October", "Joshua", "Sheherazade", "Symphony 5", "Turandot"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl69tkg", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Shostakovich"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Shostakovich 7", "last movement"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6e41m", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Strauss"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Death and Transfiguration"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl694jl", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Mozart"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Dies Irae"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl69dv3", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Beethoven"], "albums": [], "songs": ["3rd symphony"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6dlzy", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6duaq", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6duq6", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6ef73", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Shostakovich", "Mahler", "Respighi"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Pines of Rome"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6ez34", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6f0a7", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Eumir Deodato"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Also Sprach Zarathustra"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6i8b2", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Beethoven"], "albums": [], "songs": ["3rd Symphony", "5th Symphony", "6th Symphony", "9th Symphony"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6lzzu", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Schubert", "Tchaikovsky", "Rostropovich"], "albums": ["Souvenir de Florence"], "songs": ["Death and the Maiden"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl6mjx4", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cl73khk", "score": 0.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Verdi"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Requiem - Dies Irae"]}}], "bucket": "other"}

It’s currently the 2nd most steamed song on Spotify. With all this success, are we going to see more songs try to replicate it’s success? \n\nTwo very loose examples I can think of are Ed Sheeran’s Bad Habits &amp; The Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber’s Stay. Both songs are some of their respective artists’ most synth driven work. Both are also already given a push towards radio, showing that their labels really want these songs to be hits. Plus, in Ed Sheeran’s case, the [video](https://youtu.be/orJSJGHjBLI) for Bad Habits sees him donning a red suit and running around at night,  two of the most prominent features from The Weeknd’s After Hours era aesthetic. \n\nNow both of those examples are admittedly a bit of a stretch, but Blinding Lights is still on the charts as we speak, so it’s not like we’re in a post-BL world yet. I wouldn’t be surprised if we start getting more stars trying to replicate the success of Blinding Lights by trying to make their own version of the song once it starts to fade away.

So funky, I wish Daft Punk had more like it (love Get Lucky though).\n\nFinally, I also need to showcase [Soul Control by Jessie Ware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwhkvO_hCOM), although spotlight is also pure pop perfection to me. That synth line is such an earworm it immediately draws you in and never gets old.

Pushing beyond the boundaries of the funk and soul on their previous releases, Private Space unlocks the door to a wider range of sounds and launches boldly into a world of synthy modern soul and disco beats dotted with strings. It’s an organic, timeless record that’s as fresh as clean kicks and familiar as your favorite well-worn LP. Its 10 tracks are both an escapist fantasy and a much-needed recentering after a tumultuous 2020. Throughout, The Indications highlight a collective resiliency – as well as the power of a good song to be a light in the darkness. Durand Jones and The Indications have long provided the soulful soundtrack for such deep thoughts, both on stage and on your turntable. But as the world slowly resets from the chaos of the past year, Durand Jones and The Indications’ Private Space is arriving at just the right time.\n\n#Videos\n\n- [Love Will Work it Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AnXiScwWj4)\n- [Witchoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vTtnevlO4)\n- [The Way That I Do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYq5CxVnOPU)", "score": 106.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/oqsmb4/rbsoul_group_durand_jones_the_indicators_are/", "name": "t3_oqsmb4", "source_subreddit": "hiphopheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Durand Jones & The Indicators"], "albums": ["Private Space"], "songs": ["Love Will Work it Out", "Witchoo", "The Way That I Do"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Believer", "Viva La Vida", "Smile", "witchoo", "the way I do", "can't wait", "Stairway to Heaven"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_h6ej6re", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_h6em20r", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Imagine Dragons", "Coldplay"], "albums": ["Greatest Hits"], "songs": ["Believer", "Viva La Vida"]}}, {"name": "t1_h6eqafi", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Smile"]}}, {"name": "t1_h6f2yx2", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["witchoo", "the way I do"], "albums": [], "songs": ["witchoo", "the way I do"]}}, {"name": "t1_h6g1npj", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["can't wait"]}}, {"name": "t1_h6fufgj", "score": -1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}], "bucket": "pop_culture"}

The first time my friend gave me some black metal song to listen to (iirc it was Mayhem or something just as brutal) I thought it was fucking horrible! Some fucking madmen were raping the instruments, and torturing a cat in front of a microphone and recording it instead of vocals (no BS, this was truly my first thoughts on BM). So getting in was tough. Same was with death metal. But here I had help. And my journey started with this exact song - Entombed - Won't Back Down. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKIdFpqYs3g\n\n\nIt was like a door to a whole new world was just opened for me, and some awesome fucking being invited me in and gave me a beer! I loved it ever since! Entombed is still one of my most favorite bands of all time. \n\nWith time I discovered more and more bands. So here are some others that helped me on this journey. Now I LOVE death metal, in all of it's forms! Thanks to these. \n\nKonkhra - Facelift http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2uPAyeCX-8\n\nGorefest - Chapter 13 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwxeqf45POQ\n\nCrack Up - Maximum Speed http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfX2ZdoMfIs\n\n\nNow it was similarly with black metal.

{"query": "Besides Lorde's \"Liability,\" Bleachers' \"Goodmorning,\" Oasis' \"Don't Look Back In Anger,\" the song \"Komm Süsser Tod\" from the *End of Evangelion* soundtrack, and My Chemical Romance's \"Welcome To The Black Parade,\" what other pop (or otherwise popular) songs utilize chord progressions or descending basslines demonstrably inspired by or directly borrowing from Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D", "combined_text": "Pop songs that are basically just Pachebel's Canon As we obviously all know, the classic pop chord progression of C-G-Am-F (I-V-vi-VI) is basically just a simplified version of the [Canon chord progression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlprozGcs80). But some pop songs go a step further and borrow a bit more from 1680's biggest hit. Let's take a look at a few (and also some popular hits from other genres that aren't \"pop\" per se but you get the idea):\n\nThis is something I first thought about with Lorde's [Liability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtvJaNeELic), which follows a similar (though not exact) chord progression. The descending bassline rang a bell in my head and instantly reminded me of Pachebel's classic.\n\nObviously, if we're talking about Liability, Bleacher's [Goodmorning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0pocjTJQ5I) is very similar. Other than a VI instead of a vi, it follows the same progression. The minor vi does make Liability a bit more Canon-y than Bleachers but we can see where Mr. Antonoff gets his ideas.\n\nAn older classic case of Canon reinvention is Oasis' [Don't Look Back In Anger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8OipmKFDeM). This one follows Canon verrry closely until the last two chords of the progression, and is probably one of the clearest cases of Canonitis in pop.\n\nHere's a fun one: [Komm Susser Tod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc6KUlXP--M) from 1997's *End of Evangelion* is another Canon classic, really evoking a timeless aesthetic to accompany a timeless film scene.\n\nAnd what would this post be without a mention of [Welcome To The Black Parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRKJiM9Njr8)? This time in the key of G, it takes its chords basically right from the Pachebel playbook to write modern day classic.\n\nThose are just the ones I could think of in the 20 minutes I took to write this post, though. With how popular this style is, there have got to be dozens of more examples I forgot about.

When the Margrave died, the manuscripts were sold for the modern day equivalent of $24 USD.\n\nThe harpsichord solo in Brandenburg 5 is possibly the first concerto to feature a solo keyboard part.\n\nThe original manuscripts were almost destroyed in WW2 while being transported to safekeeping.  The train they were on came under aerial bombardment, so the librarian accompanying them stashed them in his coat and ran into the forest.\n\nI think these pieces are wonderful and I hope you do too.

{"query": "How can I improve my ability to hear and identify chord changes in a jazz setting, particularly when listening to a rhythm section with walking basslines and comping instruments, given that I can accurately identify chord qualities and progressions when chords are played plainly on a piano but struggle to discern them amidst more complex arrangements, and despite efforts like practicing with chord tones and avoiding reliance on memorized backing tracks", "combined_text": "How to start hearing chord changes? Hi everyone!\n\nI have found myself a bit stuck in solving this problem. Whenever I play in a jazz setting, I often times find myself completely lost in the changes of a tune. I don’t have this problem when someone is playing all of the notes of a chord all at once and am fairly solid at identifying different chord qualities and things like “is this a ii V of VI or iii” when someone is just playing chords on a piano (but nobody plays like this :p). When this is played in context (i.e. a rhythm section); however, all of that essentially means nothing to me. If the changes are in a context like pop or blues, then everything is obvious and I know exactly where I am. If I hear a walking bassline and a comping instrument for instance, then everything gets foggy and I get lost super easily because all I hear are random notes. Also the way people play seems to have an effect on this. A good example of this is if I'm playing along with a backing track. The first chorus is relatively obvious and I can hear everything perfectly fine. Once the second chorus hits and the musicians start properly comping, all I hear are random notes that mean nothing. \n\nThis is a really good example of backing track of a tune I really struggle with: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ7bChfbDbA&amp;t=25s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ7bChfbDbA&amp;t=25s)\n\nThe first chorus makes sense to me and I can hear every change perfectly clearly. Once the second chorus comes.. nothing. \n\n I’ve tried playing roots, 3rds, 7ths etc of changes of various tunes along with recordings and that seems to help with memorizing the tune, but hasn’t gotten me very far in actually HEARING changes as they happen. I also am trying to avoid memorizing a backing track since that won't get me anywhere either.

{"query": "Considering its release in Summer 2012 as part of Calvin Harris's *18 Months* era, and despite achieving success in the UK and Australia, why isn't Calvin Harris's upbeat, dance-pop track \"We'll Be Coming Back\" (featuring Example) more widely recognized in the USA, especially given its lyrical themes of a relationship ending after an argument, the regretful chorus about drawing a line, and Example's arguably unique vocal contribution that complements the song's style despite being overshadowed by hits like \"Feel So Close,\" \"We Found Love,\" and \"Sweet Nothing?\"", "combined_text": "[THROWBACK] Calvin Harris - We'll Be Coming Back (feat. Example) [Calvin Harris - We'll be Coming Back (feat. Example)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPC_evpbwDM)\n\nPossibly one of the lesser spoken-about tracks from the 18 Months era. It did good in the UK and Australia but isn't that well known over in the USA.\n\nThe song's lyrics are basically about a relationship gone south as the result of an argument and the narrator not taking well to it. The chorus speaks about how they were keeping the relationship going but eventually \"someone had to draw a line\" and call it off and despite everything they have been through, the narrator expresses regret that the relationship ended.\n\nThe song is very much of its time and fits in perfectly with Calvin's 18 Months era. Released in Summer 2012, the song is upbeat and a joy to listen to. This is also, in my opinion, one of the better vocal performances of Example, who himself is mainly known for Kickstarts and Changed The Way You Kiss Me. While he may not be the greatest vocalist, I don't think this song could have been sung by anybody else and if you're into the more dance side of pop/rap then I would say he's worth checking out.\n\nWhile the song was overshadowed by Feel So Close, We Found Love and Sweet Nothing, We'll Be Coming Back rightfully earns it's place on 18 Months and is a great summer bop, with a classic \"pop drop\" if you will.", "score": 59.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8ddkh6/throwback_calvin_harris_well_be_coming_back_feat/", "name": "t3_8ddkh6", "source_subreddit": "popheads", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Calvin Harris", "Example"], "albums": ["18 Months"], "songs": ["We'll Be Coming Back", "We'll Be Coming Back"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["THEN WE MADE THE BOMB"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_i7y141g", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["THEN WE MADE THE BOMB"]}}], "bucket": "pop_culture"}

I would argue that no one-not theory professors, not conductors- knows more about harmony on this planet than Herbie.’He has formal training and applies spontaneous advanced harmonic ideas that  leaves me scratching my head. I have used this video in my theory and jazz theory classes for a few years now, and have found it to be a highly effective teaching tool.\nBut Herbie is beyond my understanding. When I took my first improv class, we were given a lead sheet for So What, Cantaloupe Island , Passion Dance  , Impressions and.other “modal” tunes’. In the case of So What and Impressions,We were told to apply the dorian scale to these tunes. Of course, when I tried, it didn’t come withing a country mile to what Herbie and others sounded like. After more listening and practice, I was able to make a little more sense of this concept.\nA few students in my jazz theory class showed me this transcribed video of Herbie playing All Blues.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=herbie+hancock+all+blues\n\n\nThey looked at the transcription and pointed out that nothing in the transcription applies to anything that resembles the harmonies that I’ve taught and they’ve learned on their own. And I couldn’t give an answer. Theoretically, his harmonies shouldn’t work. They just do.\nI call it the “modal paradox”. Through simplicity comes complexity; through limitations comes freedom.

{"query": "Considering the complex narrative and emotional impact of Edge of Sanity's *Crimson* and *Crimson II*, and given the approach of repeated listens and focused engagement with both the music and lyrics to fully appreciate concept albums, how do others interpret the narrative details of these albums, particularly regarding the use of recurring riffs in *Crimson II* and whether they perceive them as a deliberate thematic echo of the first album's conflicts rather than simple recycling", "combined_text": "I just had the Crimson experience (Edge of Sanity). I am floored. So, I know I'm almost 20 years late to the party, but Edge of Sanity's Crimson and Crimson II are simply fantastic, and I hope there's still people out there willing to discuss it. It is rare for an album to illustrate into my mind such a well-crafted and powerful story.\n\nMy approach to concept albums I know are supposed to be good is to listen to them several times to learn them, and then sit down alone with the music and lyrics and give them my full attention. I just spent the last hour and a half with Crimson and Crimson II, and it is remarkable how strong an effect it's had on my emotions, keeping me enthralled in the story. The music fits in with the concept very well; the atmospheric and the heavier melodies are placed in perfect tandem with the narrative elements... some so good that they bring goosebumps. Stuff you'd need to sit down in front of a really good deep movie to experience otherwise.\n\nWould anyone be interested in discussing the narrative, and perhaps some of its details as well?\n\nFor example... to be honest, when I heard some of Crimson's riffs repeated in Crimson II, I was a little disappointed (when I was still learning the album). Felt like rehashing or recycling previous successful riffs was a little unoriginal. When listening to it in full along with the lyrics, oh boy, does it fit in so well - as if the ghosts of the first album's conflicts were watching over the group.\n\n[Edge of Sanity - Crimson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St6lJaiHYIc)\n\n[Edge of Sanity - Crimson II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xdj1MTQetk)", "score": 58.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/38vrtl/i_just_had_the_crimson_experience_edge_of_sanity/", "name": "t3_38vrtl", "source_subreddit": "metal", "submission_entities": {"artists": ["Edge of Sanity"], "albums": ["Crimson", "Crimson II"], "songs": ["Crimson", "Crimson II"]}, "combined_comment_entities": {"songs": ["Crimson", "God!", "Satan Stole My Teddy Bear", "a Melisa(cover)", "stuff from Moontower and Pan-Thy", "Crimson Experience", "Velvet Dreams", "Purgatory Afterglow", "Stairway to Heaven", "Crimson", "Purgatory Afterglow", "Twilight", "Stairway to Heaven", "40 minute epic metal song", "Crimson", "Stairway to Heaven", "Crimson I", "Hot creativity", "Back burner", "Crimson I", "Blinded", "Grim Reaper's Wrath of the Reaper", "Desire"]}, "comments": [{"name": "t1_crycbmt", "score": 13.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Crimson"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Crimson"]}}, {"name": "t1_cryhcg3", "score": 8.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["God!"]}}, {"name": "t1_cry94xo", "score": 6.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Dan Swano", "Melisa"], "albums": ["Crimson"], "songs": ["Satan Stole My Teddy Bear", "a Melisa(cover)", "stuff from Moontower and Pan-Thy"]}}, {"name": "t1_cry9ufw", "score": 5.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Crimson Experience"]}}, {"name": "t1_cryh5rc", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Velvet Dreams", "Morningrise"], "albums": ["Purgatory Afterglow"], "songs": ["Velvet Dreams", "Purgatory Afterglow"]}}, {"name": "t1_cryh9a3", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cryvqls", "score": 3.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Crimson", "Purgatory Afterglow", "Twilight"]}}, {"name": "t1_crz0c58", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Crimson"], "albums": ["Crimson II"], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cs42olo", "score": 2.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Dude(woodear)"], "albums": [], "songs": ["40 minute epic metal song"]}}, {"name": "t1_cry96wp", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Crimson"]}}, {"name": "t1_crym792", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Stairway to Heaven"]}}, {"name": "t1_cs3a6x8", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Crimson I"]}}, {"name": "t1_cs41ip4", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Afterglows"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Hot creativity"]}}, {"name": "t1_cs41pvl", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Bunny"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Back burner"]}}, {"name": "t1_cs41yld", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": [], "albums": [], "songs": ["Crimson I"]}}, {"name": "t1_cs42k5j", "score": 1.0, "entities": {"artists": ["Queensryche", "Edvard Munch", "Marlene Dumas", "Mark Dringenberg", "Neil Gaiman"], "albums": [], "songs": ["Blinded", "Grim Reaper's Wrath of the Reaper", "Desire"]}}], "bucket": "pop_culture"}

The song had already been performed live at the VMA on September 6 of that same year.\n\nCommercially, the song entered the Top 15 of almost every country it charted, but in the US, it only peaked at #27 on the BBH100.

Its R&amp;B sounds were like nothing she had done before in her first two albums, and it marked a departure from her signature bubblegum pop sound to something more mature.

On both his project, he switches seamlessly from rapping to singing and does both very well. There is something special in him, and it becomes obvious to anyone who has listened to his projects.

His biggest single so far has been \"Location\", which has amassed over two million plays on Soundcloud since its release three months ago, and it has every reason to be the record that propels him into the national eye: it's catchy, with a quality, yet minimalistic beat that lets Khalid's vocals be the centre of attention, and relatable regardless of what your current relationship status is.\n\nI wrote that Khalid's self-titled Soundcloud set included \"almost every track\" he has to his name. The one track it misses is his slow, bare-bones, haunting [cover of Frank Ocean's \"Lost\"](https://soundcloud.com/thegreatkhalid/lost-frank-ocean-cover), featuring nothing but his voice and a pace-keeping snap of the fingers.

He is notorious in his area for being a hot-head, fighting anyone he has a problem with. [Exhibit 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubeHO6RxNvQ).

He allegedly beat his girlfriend. Long story short, X is fucking crazy. I hope he can be freed soon and get help from those around him because his music is great and he has potential to be huge. He was building a huge amount of hype around the time he went in, both in his city and on the internet.\n\nIf his music or his persona interest you, I recommend watching his [No Jumper interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV7Q2teRLPc).

His signature fast flow that never seems forced or sloppy makes him super interesting to listen to, but that might not be the biggest draw in his music.

He first appeared as a durag-wearing white boy from Minnesota, which made him hard to take seriously at first. However, he kept on evolving and honing his craft, which made listeners more and more interested in him. He switched his goofy name for Corbin in an attempt to be taken more seriously and dropped [\"Worn\"](https://soundcloud.com/spookyblack/corbin-worn-prod-by-wedidit-thestand4rd/), which was a much more mature and \"serious\" approach to his music. The following year, him and Bobby Raps dropped Couch Potato, one of last year's best releases. Since then, however, he's been completely quiet (at the expense of his buzz).\n__________________\n\n[Jaden Smith](http://hypefreshmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/12568859_1526586384338699_1307265502_n.jpg)\n\nAge: 18\n\nFrom: Malibu, California\n\nMy favorites out of his loose tracks and features are [Like This with Rich The Kid](https://soundcloud.com/rich-the-kid/like-this-ft-jaden-smith-prod-by-the-lab-cook), [Love Me Like You Do with Justin Bieber](https://soundcloud.com/teentakeover/jaden-smith-justin-bieber-love), [Soulection Freestyle](https://soundcloud.com/soulection/jaden-smith-soulection-freestyle-beat-by-mr-carmack-beats-1), [Fire with Christian Rich](https://soundcloud.com/christianrich/jaden-smith-fire-feat-christian-rich-produced-by-christian-rich) and [Drive Fast](https://soundcloud.com/teentakeover/jaden-smith-fast).\n\nProjects:\n\n[The Cool Cafe: Cool Tape Vol. 1 (2012)](http://mixtapemonkey.com/1200/jaden-smith-the-cool-cafe-cool-tape-vol-1)\n\n[The Cool Tape Vol. 2 (2014)](http://djbooth.net/albums/review/jaden-smith-cool-tape-vol.2)\n\n[This Is The Album (2015)](http://djbooth.net/albums/review/jaden-smith-this-is-the-album-ep)\n\nIn the last year, year and a half, Jaden Smith has been doing his best to shed his image of a pseudo-intelectual (which, to be fair, was no one's fault but his own). And if the general public was quicker to forget preconceived notions, he already would have. Generally in a slow, melodic flow, Jaden's shit is soothing, similar to Childish Gambino's acoustic tracks. The co-signs he's gotten from Justin Bieber, Post Malone, Rich The Kid, Mr. Carmack and Ta-Ku show how many different corners of music are fucking with him, and that combined with him being born into money and therefore having no motivation to do music other than love for the art form could lead him into making some incredible shit in the future. \n___________________\n\n[King Vory](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdjhNtsW8AArLzw.jpg:large)\n\nAge: 18\n\nFrom: Louisville, Kentucky\n\nProjects: \n\n[Overdose (2016)](https://soundcloud.com/kingvory/sets/overdose-hosted-adrian-swish-dj-radio)\n\n- [Break Bread with Bryson Tiller](https://soundcloud.com/brysontiller/break-bread-feat-king-vory)\n\nEven if you haven't heard of King Vory, you've definitely heard him. I say this with absolute certainty because unless you were living under a rock last year, you heard Bryson Tiller's breakout single \"Don't\". [Two minutes and twenty-five seconds into the track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7cVLE4SaN0&amp;t=2m25s), you can hear King Vory's pitched-down vocals. They've been together since way back and they were together when Tiller wrote and recorded \"Don't\". \n\nKing Vory's debut tape dropped this Summer and it's a very promising project with a lot of gems on there. It features Chicago's Lil Bibby, Atlanta's Johnny Cinco and Cali's AD (twice), showing that Vory is building connections all across the country. Some records on here are straight up RnB jams and some others are just hard as hell but overall, although his delivery changes, Vory is melodic on every beat on here in varying degrees. If Bryson Tiller's Trap Soul was an RnB record with some rap joints, Overdose mirrors it, focusing more heavily on rap and dipping into RnB sporadically. \n____________________\n\n[Night Lovell](https://pp.vk.me/c636521/v636521731/14065/Cu7l3YWhDE8.jpg)\n\nAge: 19\n\nFrom: Ottawa, Canada\n\nProjects:\n\n[Concept Vague (2014)](https://soundcloud.com/night_lovell/sets/concept-vague)\n\n- [Concept Nothing](https://soundcloud.com/night_lovell/concept-nothing)\n\n- [Trees Of The Valley](https://soundcloud.com/night_lovell/trees-of-the-valley)\n\n- [Deira City Centre](https://soundcloud.com/night_lovell/deira-city-centre)\n\n[Red Teenage Melody (2016)](https://soundcloud.com/night_lovell/sets/red-teenage-melody)\n\n- [Guidance (feat. Nessly)](https://soundcloud.com/night_lovell/guidance-ft-nessly)\n\nLike Trapo, Night Lovell is another example of a surprisingly deep voice for a teenager. However, he uses his in a different to the Wisconsinite. Lovell raps mainly in a slow flow, complementing the hard hitting production he consistently gets. However, slow never means boring, as his delivery is perfect for the vibe he aims for with his music and is never short of energetic. You're always waiting for the next bar and that next bar is never predictable.\n\nHis 2016 project shows development from his debut, as Lovell sheds a threatning sound for a more approachable vibe, and is often guilty of switching his slow flow for more common and en-vogue ways of riding an instrumental. I personally prefer his first project (and that seems to be the dominant opinion among his fans), but I applaud his intentions of growing and developing as an artist. I still got a lot of tracks out of this album and his willingness to hone his craft has left me looking forward to future releases.\n__________________\n[Playboi Carti](http://67.media.tumblr.com/b5d2e759cf172a7869d1f5dfa0f9da20/tumblr_o73edxAJRF1vn0kxao1_1280.jpg)\n\nAge: 19 (turns 20 this year)\n\nFrom: Atlanta, Georgia\n\nNo projects out.

However, \"Broke Boi\" came and went, none of his releases after it got anywhere as big, and there was no fleshed out mixtape to keep eyes on him. There is still no album or tape out, and time will tell if he's taking his time to perfect his debut project or if he's been dicking around and wasting time. \n\n_________________\n[Roy Woods](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56c553b64a51d99ff82033c6/56c56924356fb0f6e040c221/56c56f6c45bf21b074160ba8/1455779712764/ROYWOODS-nlegiehn-16.JPG?format=1000w)\n\nAge: turned 20 this year\n\nFrom: Ontario, Canada\n\nProjects:\n\n[Exis (2015)](https://soundcloud.com/roywoodsofficial/sets/exis)\n\n- [Jealousy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt-IM0XJYOo)\n\n[Waking At Dawn (2016)](https://play.spotify.com/album/2uh03RWTrpLJzfrrqeEIZs)\n\n- [Gwan Big Up Urself](https://soundcloud.com/roywoodsofficial/gwan-big-up-urself)\n\nProbably the biggest name on this list at the moment (if Carti can get his hype back, that title would undoubtedly belong to him).

However, his second project and debut album (last month's Waking At Dawn) came with no features.

Buzz around Lucki (then Lucki Eck$) started building around the time his debut, titled \"Alternative Trap\", dropped back in 2013. With a slow, yet playful, soundscape, Lucki rode his beats effortlessly, with realistic bars about his life: high school, women and drug-dealing. He rapped about the things he did, and the veracity of his bars becomes glaringly obvious if you look at the evolution of his sound: his once happy-sounding beats became slower and slower, his delivery became increasingly slurred and unclear and his lyrics became less about dealing drugs and more about taking them. His health seems to be suffering and most fans think that so is his music. However, in my personal opinion, the music is good, if not better than it was. It's not incoherent, it's a window into the life of a drug addict and he's sounding like basically no one else. \n_____________\n[Kevin Abstract](http://img2.hungertv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KEVINABSTRACT_HUNGERTV_TOMMYFRANCIS_010-784x914.jpg)\n\nAge: turned 20 this year\n\nFrom: Corps Christi, Texas (currently based out of Los Angeles, California)\n\nProjects: \n\n[MTV 1987 (2014)](https://soundcloud.com/brockhampton/sets/mtv1987)\n\n- [Drugs](https://soundcloud.com/kevinabstract/drugs-prod-by-romil-1)\n\n[Kilmer (2015)](http://www.fashionably-early.com/2015/12/25/kevin-abstract-kilmer/), a short EP full of unreleased and unfinished tracks that didn't make the cut for his forthcoming album, currently titled \"American Boyfriend\".\n\n- [Puke (Version Without Carti)](http://www.hiphopengine.com/tracks/kevin-abstract-puke-version-wo-carti)\n\nCollaborative projects:\n\n[All-American Trash (2016)](https://soundcloud.com/brockhampton/all-american-trash) with Brockhampton.\n\n- [Ben Carson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLwY3LR1Xqk)\n\n- [Michigan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erHuJdYylIo)\n\nKevin Abstract is artsy, daring and in search of his own sound and lane. His sound is a reflection of someone who doesn't know what he should be and who's still finding himself, which is natural in someone his age. He dropped his debut at eighteen and has been working on the follow-up basically ever since, perfecting it while dropping loosies and working with his band Brockhampton, with whom he released a very solid and daring project this year. In his work, Abstract has showed no fear of boundaries, with forays into different flows, different beats, and different subgenres, be it rap, RnB or even basically indie-rock. Not allowing himself to be constricted by musical walls makes Kevin Abstact very interesting to listen to and keep tabs on and that could be a trait that makes his next project something truly remarkable.\n\n_____________________\n\nHonorable mentions to Pollàri and wifisfuneral, who I didn't bring up because I don't fuck with them as much and didn't feel I should write about artists that didn't genuinely excite me.

I could see how one would argue that this song doesn't fit the bargaining theme but some of the lyrics in it lead me to choose it. \"I saw him once before he died, wish it was twice mane\" \"They gave my nigga Donny 40, Dante 19, I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean\" \"I asked God, Why You let these killas live and take my homeboy's son away?\"\n\nDepression: Outkast - da art of storytellin' part 1 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRJSztf0bxw\n - Yes I could have chosen suicidal thoughts but instead I decided maybe to put 30 by danny brown. I didn't chose suicidal thoughts because I wanted to keep it interesting and I find that 30 is sort of depressing but in the end it was just about his journey's struggles and sort of has a happy ending.

Preferably with an emphasis on brass and ritualistic chants/choral arrangements. (Examples inside) Hey guys! This my first post on reddit, so hopefully I am \"doing this right\" as it were. If not, i'm sure you'll let me know. I have read a couple threads presenting \"dark/evil classical music\" but none of it quite got the feeling i'm hoping for. With that out of the way: \n\nAs stated in the title, I am looking for a particular type of classical that has a very thematic, ritualistic and dark tonality; with a heavy use of choir and brass sections. I don't mean bombastic soundtrack style pieces, but more so calculated movements with a distinctive \"presence\" behind the music. \n\nThe first example is the ending song to Deathspell Omega's album FAS - Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum. The song is Titled Obombration from 44:13 - 46:20 of the album. I would love to stop listening to this on repeat to get my fix for this atmosphere, haha. Here is a link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcSz3tu03Nw. Once again, skip to 44:13 in the videos description to actually here the song. \n\nIn case you need another example, here is the song Lucifer by Blackened Death Metal band Behemoth. From 0:00 to about 0:40 it has a relatively sparse atmosphere, intentional choral vocalizations and building/foreboding drums. (timpani's?) Next after a brief Death Metal riff the choir comes in at 1:30 to 1:55 which has an ethereal, airy quality to it.

Do you know why an album was never released or any background on the artist?\n\nMy favorites:\n\n* [Do It Again](https://youtu.be/cNw8A5pwbVI) by Pia Mia, great sample and showcases her vocals and pretty tone. I love the MV too. She was dropped from her first album, then stopped hanging out w/Kylie and is now unknown. She is re-signed and had a single I think she might have an album rollout this year?\n* [Checklist](https://youtu.be/drchDpoX0wo) by Normani, wish she did it solo but great song that makes you want to dance. No idea why she doesn't have an album out maybe this year is the year but I won't hold my breath.\n* [She Said, I Said (Time We Let Go)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6w94e4UlO4) by NLT, great Timbaland beat, no weak singer and great harmonies. Supposedly someone leaked their whole debut album so the label scrapped it? \n* [Paperweight](https://youtu.be/NpAqEbnX5_s) by Bella Thorne....yeah I know. Ridiculously catchy and Bella's vocals sounds the best on here. I really thought she could be like Selena Gomez. Fun fact this song is produced by the same guy (Ian Kirkpatrick) who produced Don't Start Now.\n\nHonorable Mention: PRETTYMUCH, I feel like they have so many songs (like 30?) enough to make 3 albums lol.
